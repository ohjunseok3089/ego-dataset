terms of our features and all of our clothes We re all guys We all have a little facial hair What else No ring here We all don t have tattoos Um okay cool Now pick an object that s uh around us and uh just something near We can go anywhere else you want but just uh that that you want to describe so here I ll start There are uh there s a table here and the table has cards on it that are both uh flipped over meaning their faces are up and also flipped down meaning the back side which is blue is faced up And the table is on top of a gray mat that s on top of or a gray carpeted rug on top of a wooden brown floor Okay you want to go next Nice Yeah Yeah And and feel free to be natural We ll talk about Just be yourself Yeah it s totally a natural conversation Nicely done good okay Now pick an object in the room and describe it in terms of the objects that are around it So I will pick an example Um this coffee pot is sitting on top of a countertop that is black looks like the appearance of marble but I think it s fake marble in front of a white wall um on what appears to be a kitchen counter It s to the left of spices and to the right of a metallic silver sink Cabinet It ll open Okay There s two kinds of glasses That s to confuse the classifier Which glasses are they Um you can pick something that s big and up close Yeah Okay so that s good all right That was chill Okay Now some fun questions Or at least questions about things you like Okay So what is your favorite kind of music Yeah All right How fancy Yeah oh cool I feel like most people who like jazz they tend to have ru well okay they may just like jazz but I ve met many people I won t say most people But I ve met many people who like jazz and it s because they have recently attended a concert that was jazz And show of yeah It makes me feel like a part of something Like like the culture Right Right Nice Yeah I felt so too Yeah I remember I went to a jazz concert when I was like sub 10 maybe like 7 or 8 Yeah and I sat there and thought like Man this is boring And then I woke up And like three hours had gone by And my parents were like very happy and they were like This is a great great time And I was very happy because I was well rested that we all had a good time But yeah I I ve enjoyed it much more much more as I m older What about you What do you like Yeah Nice Yeah That sounds awesome I like hip hop and rap I mean I always have I mean I like to make it too Yeah yeah Um Yeah no I won t I won t play it I won t play it on here but or like right now But yeah um I do enjoy it I think that it s a good outlet for um both like rhythm with words that you re almost creating a beat just with words It s just becomes beautiful and also I enjoy the fact that it makes you better at language and better at thinking of language quickly I think it makes you a better speaker and I think it makes you better at articulating things I I mean most people would say Oh you know th there s a lot of like lingo and slang stuff But actually that s I mean that s intentional because it creates a nice structure And a lot of even modern songs that people hear and they re like What is this Like I I have no idea what they re saying I can t I can t follow it I actually think that the a lot of the time it s it s quite intentional in the sense that you can look at many popular songs and they follow that I am inaudible from Sh from Shakespeare Like legitimately So each word will be a down Meaning it s like barely emphasized And then up meaning it s heavily emphasized And it ll go down up down up down up for for a 10 pattern So you get I am crosstalk which is up and down and then I can t remember which is 10 meters like 10 beats And most songs that are like well known and you really enjoy the rhythm follow that so that s Shakespeare It s like it modernizes Yeah Favorite artists Um yeah uh I like actually quite like 2 Chainz which is hilarious because he s just like a jokester Oh yeah He doesn t take himself very seriously Um most people like Drake he s quite famous Um I don t know if do you know Drake Drake Yeah Yeah I mean he s he s well known I like most of the people who are well known I think everyone has some good songs to contribute Yeah sure Yeah yeah I mean Eminem was so hot crosstalk Yeah Did you listen to the 8 Mile Soundtrack Yeah it was great Yeah yeah it was great That s good Okay Um so wait another question So what is your all s favorite season Oh right So you re like I don t necessarily like one season But I don t like winter I don t know if I like summer I think summer is nice in some areas But it s not so nice in the south It s like And no one likes winter and like the North Pole I mean there s some eventually you get high enough where winter is no longer enjoyable Uh but yes That was good Okay Um so another question is uh favorite type of animal So Well okay you re favorite animal You like it because you think uh it would be cool to how about this To be born again as that animal Which animal would you want to be born as Yeah Eagles are pretty pretty good Owls depending w no they re different than eagles I think being a some kind of aquatic animal that could go very deep in the water would be impressive I think being an octopus would be quite an uh exciting Yeah but I think that You might enjoy it right It is hard to know what does it feel like if you are like some aquatic Actually I don t know what type of uh how would you classify an octopus Is it a squid It s certainly not a fish Invertebrae It s just a generic Oh mollusk Like a scallop or something oyster I don t know It s probably some person who will like listen to this later on who s you know well inaudible Yeah I know and it s like these guys have no idea what they re talking about right now So that s good Okay um one last sort of introspective question If you could have one day where you um it was I guess what constitutes as a perfect day for you So I ll give an example And I ve given this incident before so uh I m rehearsed I ll try to give it slightly different for just for the audio to be different But basically I would like a day where I felt like I discovered something innate about people that helped me to better do work and also live my life such that I could improve people s lives more and also enjoy the what what life is already like in the world that I m in from like a better understanding Something that s not so obvious You know for example if you re kind to people uh they tend to be more kind to you That s sort of an obvious thing to learn but there are also more subtle things that are hard to to like to understand For example you only sh have you ever heard you only reveal what you heal It s actually by JAY Z It s a it s a a statement that basically says when you are like struggling with something or you re in pain from something you can t heal it until you share it you reveal it You let yourself be seen in that state So uh this is uh I think it s actually a fairly thoughtful and deep thing And to discover that and to learn something like that and then also to be able to use it to do good to either help people or see some goal that you have been working on be achieved I think that would make for a pretty fulfilling day No it can happen Yeah One day One day Yeah Yeah Yeah that makes sense What do you think Yeah I feel like I would enjoy it more if it was something I d been trying and failing to succeed at for a really long time Yeah the longer that I try and then finally the day that I got it the more that that day would feel wonderful Although I think there s a point when you ve tried for so long like a PhD or something and you ve tried for like six years When you finally get it you re kind of just like All right Like Whatever dude Like like Okay I don t know Maybe I feel like it s like I have felt like okay I was there maybe a year ago and so now it s just kind of like All right let s just let s just get this on so that we can move onto the next thing Because you ve just been to the grind for so long you can t stick your head up to like look around essentially but I know now that s a terrible way to be But I I can crosstalk Yeah Yeah well I mean I I think it is a very different perspective A another perspective is that you very much appreciate all the wonderful moments and you re not not so uh not distressed out Yeah Yeah for sure Okay let s play a little bit of a card game Do you guys know Hearts by any chance Um do you know Uh yeah but we can play with uh with with all the inaudible But how about this Um let s play Blackjack You know Blackjack We ll learn Okay I ll teach you Blackjack Um pass me the cards Yeah And while I m shuffling this you guys uh converse about um things that you like that involve uh just whatever You know continue chatting Uh maybe actually talk about things in the room All right you guys You ready So the way it works is you look at the hidden cards As you already did So good thing you re supposed to do that And now you say Hit or you say um Pass I think Or no you say what do you say Stay Hit or stay You want to go up to 21 but if you go past 21 you lose Ace is worth 1 and 11 face cards are worth 10 Stay Hit all right Hit And you busted for sure Okay um so I m going to hit All right let s see what you ve got Yeah everybody So that s 20 That is 19 And this is 23 So you win by getting the cards The person with the most cards at the end wins Uh most cards because um it s just easier But we re not going to count them We re just we re just hanging out Okay um Hit or stay Stay All right Hit Hit Stay All right your turn Oh that s great You got them again You re the champion All right I hate fives A four is not much better All right Hit You want it I know you want it Ha Ah you got a good one You you stay Okay And so what All right Um what you got Okay What you got I actually beat you even though you got 21 because I have five cards And I didn t bust So five cards and not bust is automatic win There s the best hand It feels like I cheated because I m explaining the rules as I m as we re going Now I take these Okay shall we go again It s a pretty simple game right Personally I find this a boring game but I think when people have millions of dollars on the line in Vegas they enjoy it more Hit or stay Hit Hit or stay Stay I will stay as well What you got 22 19 18 That s you Good work Yeah it s pretty luck The Yeah I mean I don t know I don t know I don t know actually you re right I I don t know if it s unfair Yeah I think it is unfair you re right I think it is yeah Okay Stay and I will hit Okay what you got What you got And I busted Wait what is it Oh it s those are All right Oh no keep that one up No no no Keep it up All right so I m going to take my cards Let me have let me have those cards We know you re in the lead We ll keep a general idea All right so uh I m not looking at the cards but just let me know what do you think you re going to do You re going to stay All right Do you want to hit Oh come on I thought that would work You re not funny I know how to shuffle It s in the one two Um I mean if you want to shuffle that s fine Do you want a hit Okay All right I will stay as well What you g what do you have Eight 18 I have 19 and I m the dealer so I win Isn t that isn t that great I know I know it yeah it s a ridiculous rule All right we ll do one more Yeah I saw it Um one last question What do you think the most interesting object in the room is Those are inaudible They just shoot out candy Yeah We

93,day_2__con_5,1,3,curtis,male,1268,2220,True,Okay so the first thing is to chat about something that we re uh that we all have in common Just based on what we look like We re all guys We all have two arms None of us have black hair We re all wearing tennis shoes Oh but yours are more they look comfier Oh yeah true Um what else None of us have shaved our arms although it kinda looks like it for me because I have I have very small arm hair We re all scruffy we re all midway Um okay cool So that was easy Now um let s talk about uh objects in the room So pick something uh in the room and just describe the object So I ll start Um I ll describe that picture It has uh cartoon characters on it and it has a mountain and it has uh someone skiing and it has a bridge It s on a bookshelf with a bookmark in front of it have books to the right and a candle holder to the left and Pez dispensers above it and books below it on a white bookshelf True We re getting very very close This is true What else It doesn t have to be on the bookshelf it can be anything Real or fake fruit Nice Okay um what about an uh the nearest mirror But you have to pick a different mirror That s true Pick a different mirror I feel like that one s been it many times so Okay those are good yeah Tell me about the mirrors in terms of what they look like and relative to each other just in general There s two of them They uh are positioned adjacently diagonal Diagonally adjacent And they have silver frames They have gray frames Oh that s a stretch I think those aren t actually mirrors I think they re just reflective But they are reflective Um Oh yeah there s many mirrors It s a very mirrored room Okay Um what do you notice about the table So I notice that there are four plates and there are four forks and four knives and four wooden place settings and they re all arranged in uh the same way facing the center And also you can draw a line across the middle and it reflects the two Yeah both horizontally and vertically Oh yeah I don t know It looks like it could get bigger Although that is very hard for a camera to detect But yeah that is that s some pretty intense AI I don t think a human could possibly see this and think that it would get bigger if they had not seen a table get bigger prior A crease in the middle yeah Um okay good So uh now point at some objects in the room and we ll all three point at it but you some person points first and then the rest of us point at it and then you just describe it relative to the objects around it So I ll start Uh That plant is inside of a gray um uh vase that is sort of shaped like a trapezoid with a smaller part on the bottom and the bigger part at the top and there s a green plant coming out uh and it appears to be alive And it s maybe four feet tall maybe maybe five feet tall Nice Nice Okay so that s good Now let s talk about things that are slightly more interesting So what is your uh favorite mode of transportation Yeah that s pretty Oh really More fascinating than uh computer or the internet Oh Okay I personally think the internet is far more fascinating Uh than airplanes in terms of what it means for evolution Yeah yeah No that s a good that s a good it s uh it s very reasonable You can also I think of the internet actually as teleportation at the speed of light Uh whereas an airplane is limited to the restrictions of human bodies Not yet Until something like virtual reality is Yeah I mean we have video chat now which is is pretty good But yeah certainly it s not as good as feeling You re like I hate it Yeah that s reasonable Okay So that was good I think my favorite is probably um uh probably not that exciting I just took the question a little differently I think it s biking because I can I enjoy the experience Not because I think it s a good mode of transportation but it s my favorite because it s the most enjoyable transportation that I ve ever done Maybe Maybe snowboarding or something I m not sure Not really Not really Yeah I ve gone hiking where I went up the mountain and down the other side But it s still artificial transportation because I didn t need to get to the other side and not in that way I could ve just driven Or biked Yeah Maybe in James Bond he he sometimes he snowboards or like on a random thing True Yeah Actually in uh sometimes in Boston there will be snowstorms um where all the roads will be completely covered with ice and snow And you will see people transporting themselves on skis legitimately transporting themselves to and from work to the grocery store Unusual but sometimes Oh yeah Next question Um So what is your favorite uh musician Oh no that was too hard I m gonna let that one soak for a minute What is your favorite season Mine is fall because it s not too cold I ve already told you this but I m saying it again Mine is fall because it s not too cold and it s not too hot Oh yeah it s nice Yeah The colors are nice Man Me and you are like the antithesis We transportation seasons No it s good Okay well what s your favorite then Yeah Winter in Alaska In Switzerland Yeah Winter in uh Alaska sounds pretty terrible to me Oh it s uh yeah it s gorgeous if you if you re bundled For like six months And you don t mind the fact that there s no sunshine What about you Spring Yeah I actually love winter hiking I really do It s just that I don t like to be freezing to death So I like spring hiking because the snow is still there but it s starting to warm up Um in the fall the you don t get the same sort of snow Usually there s no snow in the beginning of fall for like mountain hiking It depends on the mountain of course But It depend Yeah it depends on where you are All the stuff is just depends on where you are Yeah Oh totally yeah I was thinking more of sunshine So for example in the Pacific Northwest there s no sunshine in the winter So people have vitamin D deficiency It s kind of uh a little bit dreary Temperature aside And sometimes the like some places there s no uh the trees will just have no leaves everywhere So everything looks stark and very gray and it will go like that for many months without sunshine with no leaves and it s just uh it s like you re living in a gray world for three months Yeah Dang 9 00 AM All right That s fun All right so one more Um What is your favorite fruit Fruit Apples That s so chill Good for you That s good Bananas That s good Mm hmm affirmative This one s tricky I actually think bananas are the best fruit for like usage For like multi purpose Yeah I wasn t gonna pick bananas but now that you said it I was like that s so generic and I completely agree Because bananas you can make smoothies which are like the best thing ever You can put them in milkshakes which are definitely the best thing ever You can you eat them before a run and you like don t feel sick and the potassium carries you through and doesn t cause too much muscle ache Bananas are great yeah I m gonna steal your answer Bananas Okay That was fun All right let s um let s ask one fun question Let s ask one I haven t asked before Um Hm Okay Uh Hm Oh that s interesting If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability non magical what would it be Yeah Flying Yeah it s magical Yeah well I mean whatever It s your answer I think you re pushing it but you can do it I think I would like the ability to um basically be able to recall and remember everything I heard always Without effort You know Without even trying to study Basically if I ve heard it or I ve seen it or I ve read it no matter what I want max max yeah I actually have an audiographic memory yeah But it requires focus Yeah so if I m paying attention to something else and someone s speaking no But if someone is speaking to me and I am very focused on them uh yeah it s stored for not ever but a decade usually Pretty crazy actually Yeah But uh visual not so much I can t look at a page and see the page Yeah That s not something I can do I m actually not the best uh I feel like I don t learn as well from reading as I do from listening to someone speak Yeah So I think it s unusual I don t know What do you guys think Do you learn better from reading or from uh listening Yeah Yeah so I actually agree with you Uh but most people don t feel this way Who who are in like a higher education They tend to learn well from reading papers I mean papers are like the main way things are information is shared at uh you know some sort of academic level Yeah but you have to run through it It s hard yeah that s the thing I feel like when people say things like I have an audiographic memory they don t really make any claim about how they recall that information They they claim that they can but do they have to go through it sequentially or can they instantly access anything and can they jump around randomly It s sort of like a machine right We can t just randomly select things We have to actually move some kind of uh well not so I mean the idea with SSD drives is to simplify that but there is some physical constraints to how quickly you can randomly grab and access things It s unclear actually I I m not I m no expert I I m the farthest from an expert when it comes to how is memory actually stored in the brain at the neuron level Is it sequential arrays Is it random allocation Is there some sort of structure intelligent physical structure to the storage Yeah I don t know Yeah I wonder actually if the um basically do we have so for example the word ball and toy are kinda similar or round and ball I wonder if like that is stored in our brain somewhere right In some in some form I wonder if those two words are actually stored uh in similar locations There may not even be a concept of individual word at the neuron level but I think there is Uh certainly a concept like an imagination You can can imagine a ball you can imagine round And those things must have some neuron like existence So I wonder if they re stored because if they have a physical existence then they must be stored in the brain and are they stored nearer to each other than say uh you know fire and round Or a verb like run and fire Well those those might be similar But yeah I have no idea either Has anyone ever asked these questions I m sure someone has Yeah a lot of people asking these questions Why why have I not asked them before then Feel like they re so interesting Okay Um We re actually about close to 20 minutes Is there anything else you guys have in your mind that you wanna chat about in terms of things in the room I don t know what else there is to chat about in the room Feel like we ve You can look at it but I don t wanna talk about it Just because I don t even I don t even know who those people are so Uh we can call it good Let s end with a high five Try to do it really loud Well done All right good job guys So you press the button one

96,day_2__con_6,1,3,curtis,male,1252,2103,True,So I don t think there s anything that we re wearing that is too much in common so So let s talk about some other things So pick an object in the room and just describe attributes about the object What does baroque mean Yeah Nice But exciting paper on there right The whole world the whole world is connected on there This is true Okay um there s a gray fuzzy chair that looks super comfy and looks like it d be very soft to touch and it s sitting on top of a brown wooden floor and also on top of a gray carpet rug Um Um I could sit in it Why not Very comfy I m gonna bring it over Uh okay Very chill Now pick another object and describe it relative to the objects around it So for example that lamp is on top of a a stand that s made of metal it s black and gray and the lamp has a wooden uh base and it s on top of the ground which is a floor made of brown wood Cause you wanted to play games Laughs Is there anything on that shelf that you don t know what it is You know The all knowing person Nice Okay The Star Wars figure Yeah Um so uh question about color okay What s your favorite Why is it your favorite Question what do you think the color of those chairs is That s a common choice of item that people try to guess the color of I think it s actually rust Yes I think orange is a like the glasses on our heads right Something bad happened to that laughs It like it like kinda bloody or something It s like quite quite uh dark Okay Alright so what what is your um favorite season It s quite warm yeah I feel like most of the the homes don t have air conditioning so at night it s like very hot if you re on a high floor Laughs Nice Okay um okay So let s play My favorite season s fall Hands down yeah It s just that I ve said that like 3 000 times inaudible definitely knows why I love fall I like it because it s not too hot and not too cold and the weather s nice What about summer in the south though Like what if you re from Texas Or like the middle of Florida Not near the beach but like Orlando Like 115 degree summer Yeah My dad showed me a picture of this kid in Atlanta like throwing an egg on the ground and it cooking in just one minute Yeah The kid s like soaked in sweat you know And he just tosses out an egg and it immediately cooks It s ridiculous Alright let s play a a quick word game This is a game you may have played when you were younger We each say a word and we form sentences and we just make up a story So I ll start Bob No Bob runs a bookshelf laughs that is not a valid sentence Basically we are going to be a language model and we re going to spit out probabilities over words and you re just gonna pick one You re gonna draw from that distribution But it s gotta be Yeah go for it Are Of course yeah Laughs This Laughs Grant Why are we doing this in this grant What is a grant Oh grand Uh apartment Question mark Ending Next sentence but you Are or our Like the letter Oh oh you guys are still doing questions Okay Sure Question on Okay Are you Uh going The Monkey Okay okay So now we do three words Okay So So the boy was Laughs What laughs Let s try again let s try again Yeah Three words Laughs Okay so let me let me try again I love the Yeah that s great The to the door Okay now laughs We have this this these keep these keep getting more advanced but I think I m gonna I m gonna cut it here Look it gets there s a lot more advanced versions I was supposed to be I m supposed to be warming you guys up Okay alright Good times laughs Um Okay I have a question actually So this came up in the last one So what do you al think about memories This is a question about memory alright This is something I actually have no idea the answer to it s very free form So do you think that memory how is memory actually stored in the brain So there there has to be some physical representation of your idea of what a word is So let s take the word ball Okay and there is some physical neurons in your brain that help you to be able to represent the word ball understand the word ball and it s English language Mentally think of it like grasping a ball There s all these things that relate to ball And the question is is the word ball as a language representation nearer in space in neurons in your brain to the word round than it is to the to like the concept of running So you think it is Or no no to the word running okay So so it ll still be in the language region of your brain but I m wondering if our brains are like spacially if words that are similar to each other or actually nearer to each other It comes to the question of like how a computer works Random allocation memory is slower than than getting it in a a range Yeah Yeah it makes sense So then you re saying you that if the emotion s re relevant to the words or similar then you think the words are more nearer to each other Yeah So like if the words so say that you had been through trauma in a fire and also trauma on a bike ride then you would think that the word bike and and fire would be similar in space in your brain Like close to each other What s that mean Yeah Yeah Yeah I see what you re saying So you think things that come up based on emotion are nearer to each other than things that come up based on logic I think that s reasonable But then it terms of the word representation itself I wonder how that s spacially organized Just a thought Just a question Let s uh Wait as you think about it let s walk and move a little bit cause we ve just stayed in one place the whole time And as you re walking you can think about another interesting question Okay So what do you think is the most interesting type of wave and why Yeah Oh you think that s the most interesting Laughs Laughs Yeah Light waves microwaves I would argue microwaves to me are the most interesting because they have such a wide spectrum And also microwaves are actually not micro they re quite big They can be a meter in wave length Laughs Yeah That s a very human perspective No I think that s that s actually a great out of the box answer And and you think ocean waves cause you like you like surfing No it s good You guys wanna play a card game of the last couple minutes Do you know how to play Bridge I m just kidding You know how to play uh Blackjack Blackjack or Poker let s play one of those Blackjack it s easy Okay let s play a little let s play a little Blackjack Okay So Yeah do it That s good And while while you are oh yeah this is fun While I m shuffling and passing out cards a co excuse me a question If you can wake up tomorrow and have gained any one ability that s real it can t be magical it has to be possible given the physical constraints of our bodies okay One ability what would it be No no that is not valid laughs She said teleportation laughs It has to be a it has to be like a real thing Something that could actually be within the constraints of Okay I guess any it has to be a stretch Okay how about this it has to be a stretch of something we can already do So you can take something that we can already do and extend it But you can t make up something new Just to make it more interesting What do you think Ideally there are not long pauses of silence although I understand It s helpful for your thought process Laughs So like you could balance on anything Oh Why just the legs why not the whole body You ve been breaking your legs lately So you just wanna be Wolverine Yeah Um well I did this earlier but I did come up with a response instantly and I think I m gonna keep it It was that I can have perfect memory And and if I heard anything Oh is that what you were thinking Yeah Perfect memory Why Um I mean there are pe but they have no No there there are different inputs I don t think there s anybody who s both audio graphic and um graphic um Laughs What Laughs It s it s not like you have to think about these things all the time Just because you like can recall it doesn t mean you have to sit there and think about everything you ve ever known Mm hmm affirmative I would I would argue that the things that are like disturbing in your past you actually have to spend a lot of time thinking about them Laughs She doesn t know how to play It s okay Wait no no it s part of the game So so Blackjack one card goes up yeah Yeah I get to see I get to see the other card Alright So now we all look at our other card Now you hide that and your camera saw it Hopefully Okay so you choose whether you want to hit or stay So that means stay Stay okay laughs What is this This is an audio data set laughs Okay alright Yeah no it s true Alright so you want a hit Hit Boom you re done See when you get to 21 it uh basically the closest you are to 21 you win If you go over 21 you lose You have a o Ace Ace is a 1 or 11 Did you already have an Ace Oh Maybe I don t know if he knew the rules already Okay you re out because you re over 21 right now you have more than 21 points Those are 10 each Add this card If it was a 1 you wouldn t have hit You would win You would have already won Yeah so Because you would have No Blackjack doesn t matter You would have 21 points if that was a uh an Ace right Yeah no I know I just think the trick the the missing piece of information is that an Ace can be a 1 or an 11 Yeah Okay I m gonna stay and now we all show our cards Then you go Dealer shows their cards last And um You did lose We need just one more minute to finish up uh and then Okay so who won I had 18 I win Okay I won Pass the cards in Okay And we ll do one more hand Uh can you give us just uh 1 minute Thanks And uh Okay so uh what you wanna hit or stay Okay Hit or stay You want a card Okay Hit Hit You busted Okay well I m going to this is the see this is the catch I m gonna hit I m gonna stay What you got I lost You won I got a I lost You won Um yeah that s 22 Yeah Oh okay Alright we re gonna have to cut the data Oh God Can you disappear uh just turn off

words form a sentence A door Hold on hold on okay I don t know the rules So it s like you say two words Oh you you need to say three words Yeah you didn t say three words either To the door Laughs Laughs You can t count Laughs We are so bad I guess I think that sometime emotion is the index of the memory because a lot of times it s not about what you associate a thing with it s the moment when you access it Like what what type of motion associate with it right Because give an example right is like if you are so sad with certain memory right you may never be able to retrieve it because you don t want to retrieve it right Does that make sense Uh I m saying maybe the way to retrieving it isn t related to that the measuring s in space but rather emotion Is like some people forget about things right Because they ve gone through some trauma right Like they just forget about things Yeah Maybe not space but uh the way how you access it Like uh like I understand like to the words are um if they re more similar then they have like similar distance in a space right Like the way how we represents an LP right But maybe brain just work completely differently In a sense that you don t use distance to represent words you group them by uh the way how you can memorizing it is by the as emotion associated with them Like some thing you just remember just some thing you don t right And then some thing pop up right away some thing just doesn t right And sometime I feel it might be associated with more emotion towards it rather than how easy to retrieve it Yeah Like wave In the sea ocean Water wave I know Yeah ocean waves Yeah It s hard to understand Like I never know when is the right time to jump on I think I know a little bit now and I watch other surfers That s the trick laughs Yeah It s hard sometime yeah Sure Yeah Oh we need a fourth fourth player no Blackjack let s just play Blackjack It s easy Just say no pass You can always do that right We need to change the

But if you have that capability then it s not stressful Laughs Maybe Maybe there are Yeah yeah yeah maybe they re emotionless like uh they don t have emotion That s why I m saying emotionless in a sense that somehow a lot of memory are by choice that whether you kept them or not Sometime I I just feel like if we doesn t really care about certain things we remember Wait why you show my card out You re playing Blackjack you re not supposed to show my card Oh yeah yeah yeah True Laughs Go ahead go ahead Yeah You re the dealer right I give you a pass So yeah stand right If you want one more

like it when it s wet when it s soft so not dried up So the way I make it is I you can so there s a few things you can do Um This is gross and most people would never do this but actually you can microwave it I don t make it that way I I don t recommend it but it won t if you if you microwave it in something like in a mixture of water some salt pepper and some lemon lemon juice uh it will be able to heat it up While keep the juicing But a better idea actually is to bake it at low temperatures soaked in a in a marinade of water and lemon juice or lime juice with a nice layer of seasoning you can use like blackening and salt and pepper But as long as it s really covered in these juices and you don t bake it too hot so you do it kinda low temperature and every like five minutes you add more lemon juice on top layer so you never let it get dry Yeah yeah you can also you can use foil to keep the steam like to keep all the moisture in but there are some people who will like literally every three minutes they will put more um lemon juice and water on top Yeah And it ll it works It s a ton of work yeah People make turkey this way for like uh Thanksgiving dinner Yeah Yeah it cooks for like three hours But yeah Salmon is not my favorite food but I m gonna stick with that now To cook salmon Oh it s quick It s like between eight and 15 minutes Yeah it s great I think my favorite

hidden show it to your glasses We can t see hers so this is a palm DP partially observable markup decision process Look in your glasses You saw it now you decide if you want to take another card and it ll get you to 21 or not Ace is worth one and 11 and king queen jack is worth ten You say hit You say stay Stay it is Hit I will stay All right Reveal your cards So I blackjacked which means 21 right on the spot So winner keeps the cards because I m not sure how else to keep count Let s do one more round I m not sure what time we started What time did we start It was about 40 I think it s 42

tired Um Okay so let s do some quick room questions I m going to give some examples you re going to answer the questions And the examples are the questions are the examples Then you guys give me some examples okay So the idea is I ll do something then try to basically just do what I m doing So I ll start The what is the color of the cabinet Supposed to answer the question Yeah Okay What s the color of the refrigerator What s the color of the table What s the color of the lemon What s the color of the grapes Right what s your t okay your turn now Blue Black Turquoise I was talking about something else Yellow with white on it What color is the chair How is the table positioned relative to the chair The table s around the chairs Yeah it s weird Yeah Where s how s the the yellow rug positioned relative to the table What s a what s another way to say that It s b the chair The chair is beneath the table and the rug is beneath the table and the rug is under the table and the chair is under the table Nice Okay You re welcome to go in there Everyone goes in there and regrets it And some pretty stinky dirty laundry The last person who went in there had to wash their hands they were so disgusted Okay pick an object in the room and tell me about it silence Is that a gray carpet or is that a gray carpeted rug Yeah That s good What a Yeah that s something that is not observable with audio and video Cause I d have no idea We re freezing unless inaudible can see Yeah maybe My hands are cold actually That s why they re in my pockets Nice Okay pick an object another object and describe it Just talk about the shape of the object and properties of the object So I ll pick one The fan There s a fan on the other side of the room I ll walk towards it And the fan is black and sits on top of a yellow stand It s next to a black pole and the yellow stand that it s on top of is sitting on top of the wooden floor It is a it is a box fan that rotates inside the box Okay what else we got Pick something else I can t quite hear anything you re saying Um inaudible Pretty Pretty boring stuff Wait alright let s come to the middle And uh let s do an activity So um this ll be first two people then three people So I m going to walk around you and you re going to loudly say where I am relative to you And I m also allowed to talk while you are saying Where I am relative to you Just so that we can get some multiple Audio streams Okay Now I m going to do it silently Okay now this time you guys will both say where I am relative to both of you Okay great Good stuff Now No yeah It s too it s too much yelling like at each other Um Yeah so questions Alright tell me about something that you um that s a favorite thing that s not you re favorite animal city food or drink So an example is your favorite season which you like I think you like summer No you like spring or fall You like winter Someone else previously said this You want lots of rain in your life Ah it s okay So It s getting a little Um So Tell me about this couch What s on the couch Yeah that s tricky to call the backing of the couch pillows I would call those armrests They are pillows by All by all like Camera yeah I call this Like the back cushion and this the armrest Just because if you didn t have this there wouldn t be a functional couch It would be a very uncomfortable thing I think it s Closer to a crib I mean do you re That would be weird right Yeah Alright so a question another question What is your wait What was your favorite season Why Nice And your favorite is winter because you like rain And cold I know I m just teasing Um okay You do like rain What about clouds What if it s cloudy Alright how how about if it s cloudy every day for two months Would that without any sun No sun for two months Oh no Okay Vitamin D deficiency Yeah We should play a game Where you just say if you love something or not If I say something laughs Okay laughs Please describe that for Yeah okay Alright so a different question Um let s let s think about something that is somewhat interesting So what do you think about how memories are stored in the brain Do you think that memories are stored sequentially or do you think they re stored anywhere in the brain as long as it s within the region that it applies to Or do you think so say that there s some region of your brain a general area where memory is stored Not like uh reactions which are very different right Or like managing sub processes Which is not the right term but it s how I think of it like breathing and heart beating and all of this but actually just memories And particularly memories where you need to be able to recall it quickly Like words uh and language Things where you need to be constantly accessing it So the question is if you learn new words are they stored right next to each other in a very similar space or are they stored quite far away What do you think That s reasonable What do you think Yeah So I think there are similarities in your answer I wanna change it up a bit So say that you learn two words You learn the word ball and you learn no you learn the word You wa you learn four words over the course of a week One is uh uh let s look at each other when we re talking to each other That way It s it make more sense Um so say that you uh you learn shapes Okay And you learn s what square is and a circle and a triangle Um but you learn what a square is when you re like at home just joking with your family and you learn what a triangle is when you re in a very professional setting and you learn what a circle is when you re just exploring like on your own out in uh in the woods and you see something and it says You keeps seeing these circles everywhere and they s they say circle So you you ve learned all these words at different times Through very different experiences but the words uh are all very very similar in terms of what they actually mean and their association and how you would end up using them in in any real setting So the question is now what happens Do these get stored near each other in the brain or are they far apart Relative to other words Yeah Yeah That s fine Okay final question So say that there is a a guy and he s walking through the woods and there s a tree that has a new symbol on it that he s never seen before And uh he s he s older He s already learned language but there s a new symbol and he sees it on a tree Then he s walking farther along in the woods and every time he sees a tree of that type he sees that symbol What at at what point after how many times seeing that symbol on a tree does he begin to associate that symbol to mean tree Or whatever What however you interpret the question Yeah So the symbol itself has no indication of it s meaning Yeah Okay I ll add some more information to this story So now he uh this so this is a piece he doesn t observe anything else but the whole time that he was walking through the woods he was on a trail Now what do you think that he thinks that the symbol means Okay not the answer I was expecting So maybe maybe an AI could not also solve this Uh supposed to be just trail markers It requires prerequisite knowledge intentionally So it s something that if you ve ever gone hiking then you would think You re supposed to think obviously I did a bad job phrasing the question but you re supposed to think Oh okay Then the symbols are trail markers Yeah Were you also imagining that the symbol was cut into the tree Yup If there s one symbol on many many trees On the same trail Yeah Oh yeah Wait have you hiked Okay you So usually what I what I ve experienced is just like a white circle There s like a piece of white paint Or you d see Or like a plastic uh thing that s pinned with a na a nail has nailed a piece of plastic about this big onto a tree and it has like a maybe it s a g green circle on a white plaque S something like that Yeah Yeah Yeah I think that s good Well it s about time for us to

more alive this morning than usual I don t know inaudible good morning Okay Yeah Wood colored I don t know What do you call that texture Silver The cou The countertop is like black right inaudible There s some reddish ones and some like blue indigo ones Uh what are the color of like the legs on the chairs inaudible Uh wha what s the color of the base of th the lamp over there Uh Uh w which one are you talking About inaudible which one are you talking about Okay Uh what color is the the the mat the rug Yeah White white With black stripes Ta table s above the chairs Chairs are around the table Yeah but the ch chairs are also around the table That s a hard one actually Beneath Yeah and the chairs are between the table and the rug laughs You make it sound like there s something very ominous to be found inside Oh there s something now Huh A hamper inaudible I want I want th be something in these boxes But I know that there s not going to be Maybe there s something cute in there What is inside these gray boxes inside of the glass display case Yeah The outside is just plain gray crosstalk There are these two sort of bean bag like cushion things for people to sit on There s one in there one over there They re both gray One is on top of the gray carpet and one is uh between the couch and the the dining table I okay it s definitely a gray rug How I d say it s carpeting but it s not a carpet if that I don t know This I just noticed this has like a very this blanket This blue blanket has a very interesting texture It s very lumpy just blanket laying here on the couch Be good for a cold day Yeah Yeah inaudible Yeah you can try to pick something up Like people like stand more like this right inaudible their hands in their pockets You could infer that it s probably colder Oh yeah inaudible Yeah Oh add that to box fan That s not like a rotating fan or inaudible Yeah Hm What s the book It s a book Oh whoa That s a cool find and there s some Chi Chinese written on it Huh That s that s Chinese The only other books I see duplicate on this bookshelf are three oh that s three volumes okay It s the three volumes of Optical Coherence Tomography Definitely a less light read I don t Sorry laughs Should I say anything Okay You re to my left You re behind me Y you re coming towards my right Now you re on my right Now you re definitely in front of me Oh Okay Thought you might go between us but you didn t laughs I l I don t think I had that question I like I like winter I like cold and rain I do but I haven t had much chance to So I I ve grown up in southern California so that s I I want more snow and rain in my life Same Okay Yeah where d you grow up Okay sure Yeah yeah yeah Right Sorry sorry laughs laughs Well there s a whole bunch of pillows here I think it was more pillows on this couch than the last time I saw this couch Well I think I when I See there s was more spr there s There s five gray pillows and two orange and white pillows and two like teal pillows and th the teal blanket Okay well it blends These are definitely pillows right These these are fluffy Oh that s that s valid Yeah I d say like a Like a the backing of couch is a kind of pillow Yeah those are I mean it can be a functional couch without these It d be awkward but be functional Yeah okay Yeah I guess the uh It s functional but not functional as a couch I like cold Yeah No I do like rain it s Yeah I like Yeah no I love like a nice cloudy morning when everything is muffled Sounds great That sounds great laughs laughs Yeah I I love cholecalciferol Oh that s that s vitamin D Mm hmm affirmative I think memories are mostly stored by their associations Like if you taught me a new word for particular new shade of green like I d mostly associate that with you know maybe a plant that like that shade of green or other sha other color words that are obscure Um but then and that s where the word ll be stored but of course I have memory of learning the word and that s where like you know the the timeline learned would come into play So if you then taught me like you know a few other words for totally other random things I would have memories of you telling me those words And those would be stored sequentially cause those are associated by their being close in time But the words themselves would be with whatever words have similar meaning Mm hmm affirmative Whoever taught you the word Yeah Yeah I I think and this is sort of just my personal hypothesis about the brain that you shouldn t try to think of these things as being stored like a 3 D space but in some like you know higher dimensional like graph of like in which which concepts or actions are related to each other right And so like you know c circle and square and triangle are all gonna be you know connected to wherever you learned them and maybe you know the first scenarios you saw them used But when you realize that these are all representing some sort of similar geometric construct they might be all be connected to the idea of like shape so in that sense they ll be close to each other right Yeah Yeah I feel like uh I feel like if I was this like if I was hiking like a far off country I don t know like any of the writing system and I saw a symbol periodically on trees like I wouldn t think Oh this symbol means tree I d think it s probably either like someone graffitiing a tree or like a sign saying like you know this tree is gonna be you know like slated to be cut down since they mark trees or like Path continues this way Yeah I would guess that they re using the trees as like a medium to put some other information there and that the sign isn t about the tree itself as much Okay Yes that s like So I was If I was thinking if it s like like a if it s this one symbol cut into a tree that s not the most effective kind of trail marker Like usually like inaudible trail marker it s like an arrow or something so you know make sure tend that way and not that way kind of thing So so if it s just one symbol I wouldn t be as inclined to think it s a trail marker Yeah Okay then it could be Then it could be Yeah Li like if I was like you know making trails markers I d probably have like you know a few different kinds of arrows to describe Like you know make sure you go that way or that way Yeah Oh okay Oh then th that s visible from a distance yeah Okay yeah then I think trail marker I was thinking cause if you re like tryna like cut something into a tree L l like inscribing it that s not gonna be visible form a distance right So it s in the so the white circle s very good cause you can see from distance away Oh that s the way I wanna head right Where is you re cutting something in you can t see that from too far away It s more like you get there and you say Which way do I go Oh the symbol s telling me to go that way Cool,True,vid_103__day_3__con_1__person_3,False,False,day_3__con_1,True,False,False
104,day_3__con_2,1,3,curtis,male,1328,2636,True,The first thing is to talk about what we re wearing So what are what is one thing that we all have in common What kind of shoes True running shoes I m gonna get away from this table I feel like it s in the way Um okay Uh so also what about colors Do we are we wearing any of the same colors Yeah Do you have socks on Are they black socks Yes Okay that s pretty good We all have black socks And You have under shirt No reason why you would laughing Okay Okay I was just wondering Um okay Um We have shorts But you have what I know I know but keep in mind imagine a model that s like You know when we get pre Like what would it say that you re gonna say Okay all right so I ll do some really simple kinda dumb thing We ll uh we re gonna like look at this table a little bit okay So um I m going to point at objects and you ll tell me what they are I ll also give you features and you ll tell me what the object is So for example what is this object And what is this object What was that A coaster okay What is this object A plate Is it a bowl plate It is kind of a bowl plate I don t know I just made that up I don t know if that s like the correct inaudible 00 01 35 Okay what is this And what is this And what is this Yeah What is this Okay What color is the plate Off white Nice or light gray And what color is the coaster How many coasters are there And are all the coasters the same color Good Uh is there any are the Do the coasters have more than one color on them I don t know Oh that s such a good answer laughing That s so advanced Okay that s like AI 2050 laughing Yeah um okay What about the table What color s the table Uh yeah That s really really really good Okay And is this the table Is this also the table Is this the table Is this the table Is this the table Is this the table Okay all right So that s not really a conversation it s just uh video stuff all right so now ask me some questions about orientation of objects So I m gonna give you an an example and then you ll follow through with me So um for example uh what object is the spoon one of the spoons okay let s look at this spoon What object is the spoon on top of Yeah that s it We re not asking questions like that so you have to be creative Below the table is a yellow mat with white lines A yellow rug or mat laughing I feel like it looked a little bit too cheap to be like a rug So I downgraded it It s very offended but I m sorry but I just don t care For the mat I care about what you have to say I care about your feelings laughing Not the mat s though I walk all over the mat The plate is on top of a place a wooden place mat or something I m not sure actually what to call that What did you guys call it A tray Sure It s on top of the wooden circular tray Sounds reasonable Too hard Too hard I m gonna fill in the blank gaps because it you know I guess there s supposed to have a decent amount of audio Like not too much empty space Uh okay So how many chairs are there And what color are the chairs And uh if you were going to describe the pattern and color of the chairs in as few words as possible how would you describe the chairs Oh that was not what I expected Wait what d you say It s so fancy I was going to say white with black lines But but that works too Okay good So now we re going to explore the room a little bit So pick something in the room anything that you want and point at it and talk about it Just simple like one sentence like it s color and location relative to other objects I ll start Fuzzy gray ball It s a seat that s on the the brown wooden floor Try to and where are the succulents No hand movement at all Nice Okay Ah yeah That s pretty tough to see Okay Good luck Yeah I know it s good all right True It s a big hit in this data set It s a one of the more common ones I m gonna try to find something that hasn t been mentioned I think almost everything s covered I ll I ll mention this but no no um like image of that is not going to cover whatever that is I believe this is a candle holder and it s black and it s just unnecessarily odd shaped and impossible for anything to know what it is The reason I think it s a candle uh what is it Candle holder because it has this almost candle shaped thing and it s metal which makes me think wax would be okay to drip on it But it actually might not be a candle holder I really have no idea what it is Um okay You want another one Oh you seem pumped Yeah Do it Bring it Yeah Nice For the camera like inaudible 00 07 00 I m worried there s some like AI agent that s like wait what is real What is fake That would be amazing if you like trained an agent on this data set and then at the end you ask them to like create their own questions and they re just like what is real Am I real Is that fruit real Okay Fun Alright so now let s play a stupid game This one s really dumb So let s change our orientation Let me get in the middle of you guys this way Okay No No It s all good It s al The one thing that always bugs me about triangles is you can change who s right to left but you ll always be like in this same like linear pattern It s just depend It just depends on where you start So like if we go around this way okay sure Mike you re it s you and then her and then me But then you can just say okay go around the other way So no matter what orientation we are it s all the same which makes it not very interesting It s better with four people That s okay Okay So we re gonna say words So I say one word then you say one word then you say one word and make it form a natural language sentence Like it should be a real sentence that has an idea like from beginning to end So Bob The Where A Wonderful Great Very good This is a this is a pro team Very good job Okay Keep it going Couple more No totally different laughing I mean it can still be about Bob if you want Keep this story going Dog What was that Oh His dog cries a lot Other dog I cheated laughing Other Thank you Eats Good That s great Okay so now we go again Let s reverse the order And we ll do three words So my mother made Also made a I give him the nouns Like I leave all this thinking to him

weeks later I get depressed because summer or winter s there And it s nice on the East Coast because a lot of the trees change and into really nice colors so I guess it depends a lot on the city But yeah I live in the high desert right now So the fall is like really short and often then everything just turns brown rather than nice colors so it s more a sign of winter rather than a burst of a new

they will belike ahhh like so angry you know I actually also I like cats too I like dogs a lot there are some great dogs Yeah they re definitely Yeah No okay I completely agree But I had a cat Cats No this this cat only had three legs I grew up with this cat It what the one of the legs got wrapped inside of the umbilical cord while it was growing Like inside of its mother And that cat was extremely dependent because of the three legs Not necessarily in how it acted but or not not how it lived but how it acted it was very dependent So it would just constantly come up to you and you d call its name you could tell it to do tricks Oh yeah yeah It was a he but um So then I lived outside like far like in a rural area And the cat would be very far away like I don t know maybe half a mile away And I could yell the cat s name And it would come running I d just wait like five minutes and it would come running Yeah on on three legs So like wobbling yeah And well it s pretty fast for three legs actually but It would come running and like do whatever I wanted to do with it It was the best cat ever Yeah Yeah so super not normal Yeah I think uh that s a Until on their schedule They they don t want it to be Yeah all right I know you wanna sit down Let s let s chill for a bit and we ll finish this chilling I don t know does anybody what s the time Okay um let s play some cards So you

Or um like all of the same letter or or multiple of the same number Or all of the same uh like picture suit so Yeah so you can also get um things that are consecutive like five six seven eight nine But you have to have the whole hand be consecutive For it to be of any value Um And the worst is one pair the next one is two pair The next one is three of a kind The next one is uh or no the next one is full house No three of a kind then full house is two a pair and three of a kind Okay straight flush full house Thank you I m glad you re here And then Yeah but nobody gets those ones Four of a kind

them with the ace Has to be the same suit Uh well if they re consecutive that s a really really good hand But they don t have to be laughs Yeah it has to be all five All right who goes first Uh wait sorry Uh it s three of kind straight flush full house laughs And after full house you just will never get any of them Which is so the next one is a st straight flush And then the next one is a royal straight flush Oh sorry uh four of a kind is in there too Uh I forget where that was though Four of a kind is definitely after full house I think it s I think it s after a straight flush is well I think it s straight flush four of a kind Royal straight flush I think We could do the math if we want laughs Also you missed the the absolute lowest one which is just nothing laughs Which is what I have in my hand right now Just once Well I I it depends on the game but For a five card draw it s usually just once And technically you re supposed to bet right now laughs Yeah laughs All right Who won this round Okay laughs Well I m gonna be boring and fold one out on my time laughs You should call you should call Raise three hours of his time Remember this is this applies to his time not your time laughs Oh Wait wait what what do you mean he won he got two pairs Oh wait no you have two sixes I didn t see that my bad So I should probably mention as this is in a uh in a dataset I did see that you had NACE laughs And the camera probably caught that too laughs laughs We re not gonna reshuffle That changes the game laughs Now I know there s a three three there s three aces gone laughs laughs I play poker a little bit laughs Yes All though I am using the information that there s certain cards in here laughs laughs You didn t want those two laughs Oo 10 hours I ll I ll I ll match your 10 hours No I ll just match you laughs Got a king high laughs Oh I actually have That would ve been No you would ve beat me actually Because you have a your second highest card is a queen versus jack So if you stayed in you would ve won Also I ll I have 10 hours of his time I will use that laughs Wanna write some Python for me We started around 2 30 2 40 maybe laughs All right what is that object right there laughs What is that big What is that big object right there It might be green yes laughs What kind of plant is that laughs What is it What what what is it in How is it standing laughs laughs Oo You have a pair Two twos woo laughs You re you re you re searching for something Oh sure I don t know I think I think I may have gotten you beat this round I don t know I don t know Wait wait hold hold on I need a I need a card laughs It was just one All right All right I ll I ll bid uh 10 hours of your time laughs laughs Do you call me on 10 hours of his time Well if that s a yes you have to call me All right cool What do you have Oo two pairs Fortunately I do have a three of a kind laughs I know which I did laughs From him though So you guys have to work out how he s gonna give me 10 hours of your time laughs laughs laughs All right What s the uh,True,vid_109__day_3__con_3__person_3,True,False,day_3__con_3,True,False,False
110,day_3__con_4,1,3,curtis,male,1512,3137,True,Okay first let s chat about things that we re wearing So what are we all wearing that we have in common We re all wearing glasses yeah Let me see your shoes I can t see them Yeah they re tennis shoes THat s true You guys both have jeans sort of Yours are I don t know what those are Corduroy Oh I ve always wanted jeggings for men They re great laughs Where did you get them I ve never even heard of that Uni Cloud Q L O clou oh I don t know laughs Nice I would like to wear those with some orange with an orange shirt Nice Alright Oh you re great You re so you re good at this uh data set because you talk a lot It s exactly right cause a lot of people I ll ask these question and then I have to keep asking so then the whole data set is just me like asking questions and then one word answers Okay anyway um Wait what laughs No no it s good it s okay No uh this is this is very good Alright so now pick an object in the room that you can see or uh just but point at it and describe it So I ll start Um there s a pair of black glasses on the table The table is white and the white table is on top of a gray mm rug laughs Nice Uh I find that when we talk so like when people talk about objects in the room their voice so it starts high because it s their mind is engaged but then talking about objects in the room is something that you don t need to do Like we all know these things right So you re everyone gets quieter You start to get quiet because your mind is like shutting off cause you re literally just bored Yeah it s pretty ridiculous Okay so um I ll try to mix it up a little This is mind numbing in the beginning but just hang with me Um so what s this called What are those called What s that called Okay um what color are the glasses What color is the table What color are the cards What color or no What is this object What is this What is this whole thing Okay What color are the shoes Yeah It s a Yeah I think it s green It is kind of a sea foam kinda bluish green Uh what color are my sock Uh those are definitely black They re faded but they re black And what color is my leg It s not white It s not white at all laughs Oh I mean like racially but like I mean clearly I would call this tan right by definition Or beige Or what what is the right word Pink Well actually what color is skin Like what color is skin actually Salmon No Salmon is uh like pink ish I feel like my leg would be tan right Like not the adjective tan but the color noun Tan the color noun I mean slightly but not too much Okay alright so those are the boring questions um but we should do some more of them because we re having such a good time Well I don t know What do you guys think How are you feeling You wanna do some qu of those questions Well let s walk around the room a little bit then So you I ve done this like four times We can do it again but I think at some point actually would you all mind asking me questions about so what you want to do is think about it like a computer ri would right It has to identi you have to identify the object Okay so before you ask me what color something is you should have first taught me what the object is So teach me what the objects are and then ask me properties about them Fork Silver It s that s a I will not answer that question laughs I respond ambiguous It s long that s awful man laughs Pointy on the end and curved in the middle and long at the handle That s deep You gotta ask me things like what is the fork resting on top of Well answer the question Yeah what is the fork resting on top of The table Okay The table is brown Five Four laughs A plate or a bowl plate It s on top of a there s many words for this you could call it a tray or a place mat or a setting It s a chair White with black stripes Potentially dark brown but I m gonna em black Four chairs Yeah no it s I ve well I ve I ve done that a hundred times Okay So let s play a word game alright We re gonna make sentences and to first it can be random but the sentence should be a meaningful sentence but it can be arbitrary in terms of what it ends up being But it should have like a cohesive thought Alright so Bob so let s begin Bob Okay fine Alright next sentence Sue laughs anything Let let it let your m pretend your mind is a language model Let it run What pops in your head What s the word that pops in your head Okay Sue is blue Okay Okay these are all quick statements This time you start Thoughtfully The fridge Oh interesting That s actually interesting that I for I guess my my mind can just go like It really should make sense it should be a meaningful sentence but it doesn t have to you don t have to think ahead about where the sentence is gonna go but as the sentence is going you know make it make it be correct English laughs I mean it s okay man This isn t like something you do in real life or that you need It just makes it laughs Okay let s start again Alright Um this time maybe it ll be easier for you since it s harder for some people and easier than others so this time we ll do three words at a time Okay The succulents became laughs Um My mother made delicious laughs My mother made dinner for our party for Bob It It s okay Alright Alright Can you do ten words at a time The person walked down the street when they were upset last night You just make up words I just made up words I have no idea how many words it was but I mean laughs so then three I would just cut it off at three right cause I can at least count that much Okay so The window sill Hey There we go Now we re getting a rhythm On more okay but this time try to make it long like try to keep the sentence going Okay Yeah yeah yeah A camel s hump laughs laughs The cloud weather with uh pouring rain Good enough Good enough Okay let s let s quit doing that activity Um that was a good time Aright so let s talk a little bit about um how we think the mind works Okay So um the question is how are we doing on time Oh we re great Okay So the question is uh when you learn a new word alright so I m going to teach you a new word Bajoong Okay I don t even know how to pronounce my own word but it s bajoong Bah joong Yeah okay And that word is means the sensation of your hair prickling up on your skin That s bajoong Okay I m gonna teach you another word inaudible Okay laughs And that word means it s the feeling that you get when you get spooked like at night It s like that feeling you get when you re walking through uh you know the word is actually badook Okay badook Badook means you feel spooked like but not just spooked it means that it s nighttime and you re spooked in the sense that like you think someone s gonna come run at you That s badook Okay Okay Alright And then I m gonna teach you a final word and that word is mant And mant is um a type of nutrient that makes makes people smarter Okay So there s mant badook and bajoong Bajoong Okay These are the three words we just learned Now the question is where do you think that bajoong and badook which were both sensations were stored when you just learned them just now closer together in a synaptic regions of your brain than the other word which was Mant Good job That s the question Do you think that the two words that both mean sensations are stored to closer together in the synaptic regions of your brain than the other words which just means a vitamin or something something that Okay So and that s all No more interesting thoughts are coming to your head based on all of the words I just said laughs laughs yeah that was too hard yeah Alright um okay if you say that like uh so you thought that because the words were similar sounding okay what if all three of the words had been very very different in terms of how they sound but still two of them were very similar in terms of what they meant Do you think that they would be um those two would be closer together necessarily or like in the average of all people s brains Yeah Yeah I think actually you made me think of something So I like to rap I m a rapper and when I hear music in particular when I hear anyone say a statement I always think of a song that s that I could like sing or say that s related to that statement Or when I m saying words I often think of words that sound like them All the time I didn t used to be like this I didn t used to think this way I wonder actually if over time because I was making rap music and I was thinking about rap and I like rap and I listen to it a lot if actually before there was some method of storage some like pattern to how things were stored in my mind but then my mind actually started to reconfigure the storage to make the words be closer together that sound more similar What do you guys think about that Does that sound plausible It s not a quiz by the way It s not a quiz just so you know Okay okay It s very chill like Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Oh no it s cause you seem you seemed so serious like you were like it seemed like so serious laughs yeah maybe maybe it is a serious topic actually Mm hmm affirmative Second language yep mm hmm affirmative Yep Yep Yeah So other people have said answer like they thought that things were not related to each other if the if the concepts was related to the word but they were actually related to each other by time So when you learn them sort of like it builds up you know Like you start with a core of idea and then synaptic regions build up around it so the more complex things would be farther away from the things you learned like years ago So you were you have some sequence So then you re actually arguing that maybe uh memories and r words are stored not necessarily all memories but this type of memory like a knowledge based fact memory is stored not even a memory actually just like trying to store a fact it s potentially stored sequentially So that yeah that s what other people said So they were saying yeah not just the time that you know oh that you can imagine building up this way but in some sort of linear like encoding in your brain where you actually have to run through the you re actually running through a memory not a fact not individual facts stored but a full memory that you sort of have to read at the start and get to the end Yeah Yeah totally Yeah I totally agree Yeah I mean this and this all might be wrong so then someone else said that they thought I don t agree with this but they felt I mean it makes sense they were thinking that the brain the way that you store things in the brain is actually based on feeling So the way the word makes you feel if certain words you associate them with like darkness and bad and like like a feeling like how does the word make you feel then that s how it s stored And it and that really the fact that it s a word has nothing to do with it In fact all your memories that sort of you associate with some feeling over here and other feeling or I don t think that s true for me but it might be true I don t know It s and also there s a question of if there s any any general rule at all I m sure I m gonna move around a little bit with you Associate numbers with what Well so I think anyone can do that if you are trained to do that Particularly the younger you are the earlier you can learn these like methods of learning I think that you can so I feel like we re quite meta Like we can learn ways to learn ways to learn ways to learn I absolutely think so I think that we can totally change for example the people who win like Guinness records they always have a trick So the one the person who was able to remember Yeah there s memory palace You build a room and you associate every object like when you meet someone you can meet see 52 people and learn all their names and then you just associate a name with every object You build these constructs and then if you ve done that since you were five years old it s just so natural and quick No I mean I don t know you know it s like people argue that you can t learn a language but I didn t learn Spanish until I was like 18 and I I won t claim that I m like uh you know brilliant at it but I can uh I m I m okay I don t know Okay so that was good let s look at let me check the time Okay laughs alright let s play some cards we ve got a few minutes Well we can play are you are you in the next session Okay so let s play uh poker Oh Did you You know like a pair two pairs So basically the more good stuff you have probabilistically the better your hand it and what you wanna start out with is you wanna have high cards if you ve got no pairs it s like ace is the highest king and if you uh have a pair the higher the pair the better too but having a pair is good Having two pairs is better Having three of a kind is better Having full house is better Yeah no straight flush then full house What the hell laughs Okay There s a lot going on right now Yeah I m going to exchange three How about you guys Yeah what do you got Pick Two it is What about you Two Nah just the one time laughs Well that s cause you drew poorly So I actually have a pretty good hand Um Now we bet Okay So I bet ten hours of you alls working for me laughs Okay laughs Okay what about you Yeah you raise me I call your ten hours and raise you another 50 hours of work Okay see what you ve got laughs Hey Good job Yeah so the point of poker is actually it s about lying This whole game is lies Okay Alright let s play again Fine Good job That s how that s what the last person said I m much more focused on like the the data actually Yeah then I m not really focused that much on the the card game But then I like that you are focused on the card game Yeah yeah yeah Yeah I m doing a really crappy job because I feel like it takes longer but now I m starting to change my mind Let me do one legit shuffle Have you ever seen a magician They re so incredible with what they can so with cards It s so great You gotta g keep some audio Nonstop audio In real life if someone talked this much I d slap em laughs Well you know what I m you know what I m saying Not actually slap Oh Alright Imma take two cards What about you You can do whatever you want On card to Alright you go first with the bidding The bidding No No not actually we re not actually going to gamble Look look look Okay what about you a hundred points The points are arbitrary and meaningless Let s go A hundred and fifty I fold What Uh No raise him raise him He s bluffing This is so obvious Oh my god you re so dead Oh you re so dead You re so dead He got a Roy A royal straight Dude that is like one of the that s a really good hand Yeah if if they were all the same suit that would be the best hand in the entire possible game crosstalk of poker And also the probability of that occurring is ins ridiculous That was ridiculous That s like the probability of that is like one over fifty to the fifth is basically what the probability is laughs laughs yeah yeah

but I think that s a little bit too much Yeah Yeah crosstalk 00 01 21 yeah Cool Do you wanna go I was gonna talk about the book in the closet over there that says Practical The cover is like purple and it says Practical C Programming Like alrighty The closet is white Don t know what else to say about it except that I want to read that book cause I kinda I need to catch up on my C Yeah laughs Okay A table Cards Glasses Black White Blue Shoes Socks Your leg Green laughs Yeah I consider it to be green It s green ish but Yeah Gray Uh Okay well I I ll go for gray Pink yeah laughs Yeah Yeah I

Okay oh you wanna do that first The table How many forks are on the table Are you sure laughs And what is it resting on top of Um what is this here What color does it have Yeah I I have to say I liked the the naming of the objects myself better Cause now you have to think of questions that are that are not quite that are kind of crosstalk 00 06 47 but not too Okay Is laughs laughs Uh is laughs crosstalk Okay Explained To It doesn t have to make sense it just has to be like a laughs No it doesn t have to be meaningful in the sense of like very deep and intellectual it just like it has to be an actual sentence that somebody could say and not be completely ridiculed Yeah You wanna Okay Oh this is way harder for me Okay can we do this again silence dinner for our laughs Dude I mean it didn t It s hard I have to say Sure is next to laughs Okay but give us a from that is easy to like Dude Come on you re like tricking me Talk about like mundane things you know is really annoying Oh God like Okay Okay Bajoon Bajoong Okay Okay Yeah that I can t pronounce Badook crosstalk Bajoong Yeah Mant Yeah Um I would say yes Yeah I I I m pr I m inclined to agree with that laughs yeah yeah I was doing crosstalk 00 12 44 No I mean I think you re saying that when you form representations I mean I I think we re both saying that when you form representations like semantic plays in to that just semantic similarity and and just like how do you say that like aud auditory similarity just like the similarity of the word itself right So I mean I s I suppose it becomes interesting once you already have a whole bunch of words and you re like sort of putting new ones into them right Like you learn words one at a time laughs It s a serious topic I think it especially matters if you re learning a second language Like cause like if you re learning words that are in your own language like it s very easy to know how to pronounce them But when I m learning like Arabic or even when I m like I like when I learned English It s like harder for me because the sounds are not completely like natural for me Yeah and then like semantic idea like o once you grasp it you sort of like get it right like the the pins and needles on your arm like you don t really have to very much formalize what exactly that feeling is like you know what it is Ah But then you have to be careful when you say stored in like the brain because you you have like different areas of storage right Like you for for instance you have like hippocampal memories and then you sort of like replay those and upload tho but like so I think that the temporal context is gonna play a lot of role in like hippocampal memories um but but then once you start uploading those then you probably like start putting like clustering them and giving them semantic representations and Mm hmm affirmative You re talking about memory palaces and I I wanna play some cards Cause you have these cards on the table crosstalk 00 19 23 I don t know what what kind of games do you guys play Yeah I am Yeah Yeah Yeah it s straight flush laughs This is actually a hard one Oh I ll go two This is probably a very bad decision on my part Okay I I I fold cause I have those are garbage Look I was going for a flush but you know I have literal nothing Can I see Oh you raise him You raise him ten hours of his time Plus the glasses that he s wearing I don t know I mean it s possible that he s got trips but I don t think so I think you should just call If I were you I would call Oh no You ve got to show first because you were the last one to raise it He oh dude you got it You totally got it Wait what can we shuffle these cards in otherwise it s a The cards instead of the game Like if I m gonna play a game I m gonna play it right I like that you re narrating your shuffle Yeah laughs Okay so I ll show you how it s done What you do is I exchange no cards at all My hand is perfect as it is You want to show me your hand I can I can give you some tips But I m gonna be re raising you pretty heavily here The betting Oh d what are we betting for Could we bet money Oh only time Don t show your hand man you re showing every card in your hand Okay I ll bet a hundred points Points Yes You need to fold anyway cause Yeah laughs I I I ll make it 400 I m pretty I m pretty sure that like I ve got you beat here There s like no way Okay well that s great

away I mean you could have like a Oh yeah two pair Yeah Especially to get that like dealt out of the blue Ah true Yeah also it feels like a total bluff right cause if you get your five cards and you say like I exchange nothing my hand is perfect You re pretending that you ve already got an amazing hand Well you did a good job shuffling laughs Shuffling W w w hold on I don t have it yet No whoa

113,day_3__con_5,1,3,curtis,male,1385,1869,True,So let s begin the conversation Of the afternoon Yeah alright so let s imagine an animal okay Um but what does that mean You re not going to imagine an animal You re going to imagine that you re going to pick up a dog okay to for purchasing This is going to be your new pet Alright And you are on the way to pick it up It s about to be unveiled to you I want you to imagine this okay In one second literally one second your new dog is going to be unveiled to you alright Now y you you already have seen you ve seen the dog prior like in pictures and things And and you re going to somehow be able to like be given this dog Okay you re going to in some way you re going to be given the dog The question is how is it going to happen Like what is it in your mind So for me I m going to turn around the corner and the dog is going to just be standing there wagging its tail and its a golden retriever and it has long hair and it s like a on top of a like a one of those kennel like cement gray grounds And that s just me and yours should probably be very different Mmmm affirmative And what s it look like Shiba Okay I m gonna turn the fan on A Husky What kind of Husky I only know one Alaskan Husky Yeah Yeah and then That s good I like your description Okay Uh so we did one before that was there s a person sitting on a bench and they re in a park Can you see him Can you see the person That s fine That totally fine I m just gonna ask the boss Okay so uh what is uh what do they look like What are they wearing Okay what is is there anything else Okay And what s the what s behind them How many trees Like a lot of trees or one tree The bus stop Okay so what s behind him just the bus bench Anything behind that And in front of him is that road or sidewalk And where s the park There is a park though Laughs What Okay okay that s fun Alright let s do one more So um you are you re sitting on an airplane and the person in front of you sneezes out into the aisle Okay What so you see it Okay what do you imagine happening next Okay Yeah Laughs that s what that s what I imagine too yeah Laughs Laughs What do you mean clean it up Sneezing doesn t like Yeah Okay I was I was I was good with it but I don t know about anyone cleaning up a sneeze I think I was imagine people just being like Ugh You know like making a really gross sound or Oh like particles So I think the person who is like on the opposite side of the head tilt would say bless you but the person who was getting shot at Would be like Ughhh You know or be like Uh like Uh gross Like I it s a terrible human Okay good Alright let s walk around the apartment a little bit We re gonna talk about some objects Um so we re going to identify some things We ve done this Alright What is this called What color is the rug Also I agree it s a rug not a carpet Yeah I think that they re you could call it a rug or you could call it a mat But definitely I would not call it a carpet Um what color is the I already asked this but what color is the rug Nice Yellow it s lemony color What It s lemony color I mean okay that s actually really interesting because do you think that any sort of computer could ever get that right It s not even a real like I don t even know if it would understand because it s not even english Like you ve totally just made up a fake word Yeah I would say it s I would says it s it s a yellow rug with white patterned lines Forming lemons I m just making I m just making noise Just for the sake of like a computer trying to interpret okay um Yeah No no yeah don t You just chill let me be meta Yeah I know That d be pretty I feel like the sad thing is that to be a smart computer you have to speak dumber Right If you use like okay dumber in the sense of colloquially Like if you use good english you re considered to be smarter Or if you use your language correctly But if you make up words all the time and you re like lemony la la la la then it s like no offense Like it a was perfectly fine word but then that s considered like less like professional slash intelligent Yeah I mean that s what I I m not gonna get into that Yeah It s reasonable I like your support Okay tell me give me some a few more objects Ask me what they are That s a table What color is the table Okay Ask keep asking keep it going ask questions Looks like it s made of wood but could potentially be fake Fake wood Potentially That is a fuzzy gray chair Sitting on top of a brown wooden floor If you don t like the word chair you can call it a location for resting your buttocks Beanbag sounds much better I don t I never had a Never had a beanbag Or you could just call it a relaxing object Made for relaxing That is a chair A high chair With blue legs because there s blue tape on top of metal And the chair is colored rust Or some kind of orange brown red That is a photo It has red it has black uh photo frame a black photo frame and there s a picture inside of it Nah it s too complicated for me For my brain My A I brain Okay so that was fun Let s do a a word game Did we play this we make up sentences Yeah You ve never done the sentences Oh really So I I say a word you say a word we make a sentence Oh yeah am I too low laughs I m just I m just I m just laying on the ground Let me get up Okay here um I was comfy Okay so Bob Very Period Okay I Run Magical Forest Bob has a forest Bob s got that money sings Okay Then Spit Garbage can Okay Alright Now you ll be three words You start Filling our stomachs That s that s done Okay your turn Three words Had a bit Fridays

movement You know audio for like spatio reconstruction I don t know where you re going Where you going Okay Okay while you re looking around let s tell us what you re looking at That booze bottle is new What do we have here Maybe no we don t have to focus on it too much What else So what uh let s be a little bit more structured in our approach For those approach shoes What is this Kitchen island Yeah Okay wood counter Or kitchen island crosstalk okay what color is it You get in one word I would have said brown Light brown is two words Okay and what is this part of the table I would think it s a table top So I d say from here up is the table top and from here down is the rest of the table What color are the table legs Okay and what is let s go underneath Can we crouch down together Okay so what is this object Wait come around Large pot Okay And what color is it It s blue Good Okay so yeah What color is the top of the pot bump Yeah We ve got a black nob but the lid itself looks like it s made of glass Something clear Yeah yeah Oh Nice Um And what is that pointing We ve got a handle yeah And what color is it What color is the inside And what are these four objects I would call them skillets but Pan is the same I I would always Skillet is my go to for sure I think skillet is a Regional Yeah yeah Alright I don t know what this is Nobody knows what that is What is this Like what are these Cutting boards What color are they And uh what part are they resting on What color is the thing that they re resting on Nice Great Good job You all are official labelers of the world with your voice Alright pick an object in the room that you find interesting and describe it in terms of the objects that are around it So I ll go first Uh the silver refrigerator is on top of a wooden brown floor to the left of a kid kitchen cabinet that has a black top and it has brown drawers and it s against a white wall Nice Okay laugh Uh do you have another object in mind Cause if not Okay The painting has been done Many times Pick uh pick something How bout the helmet The helmet s never been done A hat box Really That s weird It s actually a hat box Like for a baseball cap or Hmm Oh Okay Interesting No no one has talked about the knives Scissors That s good Okay Let s uh let s have more of conversation now So Um I wanna ask you guys a few things So if you could have a super power but it can t be magical it has to be something we can already do as humans but you can just do it a little bit better Reasonably I mean there s physical constraints to why we are what we are You can t it can t be impossible it has to be a real thing Yeah Um That s not possible It s scaled down Yeah But it s it so So that s perfectly great I enjoy the answer I wanna direct the idea slightly different It s about a skill you like you have to you d have to learn all that stuff So are you saying that your ability would be to learn language very quickly Okay so that s the skill you want Mine is to never forget anything Yeah so just have better memory Like but has As good as it can possibly be within the realm of this game What about you Yeah That s fun Okay That s good Alright Let s walk over here a bit closer to the fan And um I ll ask another question So this time the question is to describe what um a perfect day would be Just in a couple sentences So just describe like to you what would be a perfect day Nice And that s it Everything else is perfect Nice That s not uh that s not interpretable to everyone Type two means that someone who likes to push themselves and even when you feel exhaustion maybe pain you still push yourself because you enjoy the fact that you re achieving like something that s physically difficult So like conquering a physical task And it s not this is not like a real word This is sort of a made up There s a type one type two of everything There s type one personality type two personality There s type one hypothesis testing type two type one errors type two it s there s always a type two I think wait any more What else happens I think my perfect day would definitely uh it would have to involve discovering something that is very challenging like very hard to discover Not challenging in a necessarily intellectual sense but something when you know you have just stumbled on like a secret of how people work Or a secret of the universe Also growing closer to the people who are most important to me and knowing that you fundamentally got over like a hump that had always been there in a long term relationship and you ve moved past that somehow Whatever it is and whatever form it may take Yeah Yeah I think these would like maybe yeah So like people and then work life and then also I think having a good workout Or just doing something for myself that was made me grow Not just in the sense of like ability to understand but also just for my own things And like uh like I physically felt like I had grown stronger or healthier Yeah and the more the better I guess I think that sounds good Okay So last question Where you wanna go We re going for a walk Okay those are called succulents Everyone has decided this is the term Um Okay so question Actually you all stand closer to the fan this time Because I ve always stood closer to the fan cause nobody wants to stand next to a fan Oh yeah that s true Uh what do you call that again a bag A cloth bag Yeah Yeah Okay Um Maybe uh No it s good it s close Okay so um the last thing is the imagination thing Which we did before Okay so What we ve done in the past meaning I ve talked to other people and we ve talked about people sitting on benches um in parks and then he was telling me like what does that person look like Right Cause when I say certain things to you you immediately fill in with details and there just your mind Which is interesting to see how the mind works But we have to come up with a new one So So it s your first day of a brand new job okay And it can t be anything you ve done before I mean it can whatever whatever pops into your head but it s your first day of a brand new job and you just walked into the building Okay See it you just walked in the building Imagine yourself walking through what color is the car or the ground Or if it s even carpet I don t know what color is what what does the ground look like Okay Industrial concrete or gray Aayyy Dude so I think So okay So I this is not like a thing it s not like a psychic anything But I think it secretly tells you what you want where you want to work So you have to think about places that have checkerboard I don t know Well no offense Like it s not offensive I mean I support but but Rally s has uh a checkerboard you know Rally s It s a fast food restaurant I don t know if that s the best crosstalk Ooohh laughing Nice Wait what s your Yours is industrial okay Okay very ornate I just imagine walking in and seeing a blue carpet Like cookie monster blue And I think actually it s because of the room I grew up in when I was a kid from like zero to 12 It had blue carpeting Yeah And I think that s why that s what popped in my head I don t know I don t know what that means Yeah Maybe as my job I want to be I think it means I want something with a lot of freedom and and naivety And like honesty And yeah Something that something that doesn t yeah pure Something that s pure That must be what it is Okay so that s good Alright you wanna play some cards How s your poker Regular Texas hold em Okay Yeah let s play a little bit of cards What time did we start Like uh 44 444

water is versus what s the bottle Nice And what s the water bottle on top of Nice And uh what s that Uh what color are the glasses And just the frame or I don t understand what color are the glasses What s the frame and what s the glasses Laughs I don t know explain Yeah I think it s it s so I think technically these are like ear pieces I m not sure what the right word is but And then this is the frame and these this is the lenses And the whole entire thing is the glasses Laughs Just just because Someone tried to train me maybe one day and they were like uh AI s going to be very confused Okay If you seen me scratching it s because I went hiking and uh I got bug bit so it was really bad like okay Let s uh let s walk around the room a little bit We re gonna talk about some objects in the room Um I wanna do something different this time because we ve done that table like seven times So there s some garbage here Maybe we should make that not the focus And uh I want to talk about this object So what is this What color is the umbrella Sounds good and uh Wha What s the patterns on the umbrella I I would call it polka dotted Multi color polka dotted With green blue purple red and yellow Um what is the umbrella leaning against What color is the dresser Can you point at the dresser Can you point closer Um what is Can you name an object sitting on top of the dresser So I see the helmet And the helmet is what color Yeah white s good And what about this What s this What s the painting leaning against And is the uh painting to the left or the right of the helmet Is there another helmet on the dresser Is that to the right or the left of the white helmet And is the black helmet sitting on top of something It is a hat box Yeah it s a hat box which is ridiculous None none of us know why it s empty um yeah Okay so fun times nothing less than engaging conversation but it s helpful Okay so now we uh we ll play a little game So this game is uh is very simple I say a word have you played this before Okay I say a word and then uh you say a word and then you say a word and we ll just go around in a circle Okay It has to be a legit sentence It does Yes I know this is you see his face laughs He s like legit laughs No laughs Um it should be it should be appropriate Yeah So let s try to make it a happy sentence Alright so flowers flowers In The Period Okay So that was good That s what Butterflies When Big Perfect Okay and let s do one more pause Person Intelligent Wise Learn Change For okay no worries Yeah the better laughs That s right that s what I I was going for No it s good it s good Okay um alright so that was good Now we do three version You remember The three word version That s the one you hated Let s have a good time Okay so um how does it go I say three words and then you say three words and then you say three words and then you say three words And then we just keep going And let s try to make a sentence Let s keep it happy this was good Okay Alright So um sometimes I like Uh Well laughs I know Um it would be in a computer like video underscore game laughs So video game when I Um worked very hard period Okay your turn Three words Have lots of laughs Okay you re a procrastinator Okay Yeah So now this is the hardest one So I ll do three words but this time you have to uh like do a certain topic and I ll choose the topic Or you can choose the topic actually I ve been choosing these topics all day Okay Alright so the topic will be about the Olympics Or just sports You know But like but like hard core sports um and it should be uh trying to go for motivational but happy is close to motivate Just whatever you can come up with alright But we re gonna do Olympics and then you know positive message Still three words I know this is a lot happening In our brains Okay so I ll begin Um the fire torch Are you familiar with the Olympics laughs Of a noble laughs laughs Okay we re gonna We re gonna we re gonna inaudible Oh I was supposed to play music I forgot I ll do that next next round Um okay So that was good Good times we re having a good good time Yeah Um Cool Okay right so let s talk about some things we like Alright So tell me about Uh actually do you remember all the ones you you ve done All the what things you like like places sports food Did you did we I do that with you Oh okay I keep forgetting to do that with people Okay So uh tell me so basically I ll ask you about a topic and then you say what you what you like and why you like it Alright And feel free to get excited and interrupt each other and just have a very natural conversation laughs Okay So what s your favorite season and why Why Spring comes after winter laughs So Yeah Fall s my favorite too I think actually north east area fall is the bomb Yeah cause summer is pretty hot And then winter is just miserable it s so cold and spring doesn t exist It s like cold and then hot Yeah Yeah so okay so on that note for spring I definitely dig that first day when you go outside and you don t feel like you re freezing And you re miserable and it sucks You know that first day you walk out and you re just like awesome It s gone yeah I m like soak up the vitamin D Like like I feel like a plant absorbing the sunlight Yeah But then but then I think that fall for some reason can last a lot longer So I get that awesome vibe and then it just gets hot really quickly And so then I m like oh yeah that was great but now like I m like soaked and It s in the fall Yay Yeah it s in the fall Yeah Totally Okay so you have three theses right here One is that actually my question sucks because really the thing that not that you re actually implying that but like let s be real You re saying and I kind of agree with you that actually maybe what we think is our favorite season is really a function of our is our birthday in that season or like related to it Uh is it the grass is greener like the next thing or is it just like you know you re somebody who s not really focused on the now but you re kinda just like always looking forward to the future And the answer is probably yes on all those because right now it is summer and we re talking about how we re all looking forward to the fall So maybe yeah I feel like if it was winter I might be like damn I love spring Spring is just wonderful I really like spring Okay that was very thorough laughs No it s good it s good um yeah so one more Um uh so what is your favorite drink and why And it doesn t have to be alcoholic like mine s a milkshake because milkshakes make me happy and I think I was born with like something in my brain like a milkshake neuron that just fires like crazy when I drink milkshakes I don t know I love milkshakes No I haven t crosstalk Alright well I also No no no no no no I m sure they re amazing I m also pretty healthy I m one of those people who drinks uh what I call a milkshake may be would not pass Well I might throw some protein in but mostly it s a banana which is a smoothie but I always throw a banana in cause bananas make anything that s blended that you drink amazing And then uh yeah Maybe like some chocolate ice cream that s made with like fro yo So it s not too heavy on fat and sugar and then skim milk So it s like actually not that bad for you That s why I drink seven of them in one sitting I also make my own milkshakes cause I m cheap I m super cheap Magic bullet Yeah Yeah I ve got one I actually like shipped it to my place I know I know I m way too into it laughs laughs Oh yeah No true What Okay what if you just drink that fizzy water So you just need what what if what if I gave you fizzy water and like a cup of sugar And I just poured the sugar into the fizzy water stirred it up and gave it to you Yeah yeah Okay I have an idea Can I just give you like a cup of something someday That that that is safe and healthy And then you drink it and you tell me if it gives you the same effects Oh my gosh I m so down This will be great I won t no I won t But it ll be it ll be only like like four things you know Like safe digestible food coloring and like sugar and water that s fizzy Okay I mean I ll honestly give you But yeah I can reduce the sugar yeah I can do 20 grams instead of 43 Okay another question so This one is um an idea question Alright so we did a bunch of idea questions Um I ve asked a bunch of people how they think knowledge is stored in the brain I think that s my favorite It s one of the most interesting Also asked about uh what do you imagine in your head if I just say a thing like woman sitting on a bench in a park Well what is she wearing Cause it s amazing your brain just like like fills in these details And the more we talk about it the more details Suddenly the park is growing and like you can see How far up can you see Some people can see like 500 feet Like they literally imagine the woman in the park that goes out real far And some people just see this woman on a bench And like their they their vision doesn t go out very far So this is fun Let s I m just talking now it s not actually a question The question yeah Okay but but what is right in front of her So she s sitting on the bench right Bench is here What is right there in front of her And then right and then right and then right in front of that She has a dog What color is the dog What kind of dog Oh yeah Okay And what is the dog doing How is he like this on the ground like how I m laying He looking around or is he just looking straight Kind of bored or alert Isn t this great Isn t it great Oh nice so there was a stroller next to the woman on the bench for you And what s the is the stroller look like the stroller that you like own Okay and is there Do you see anything else in front Is the bench like in front of a path or a sidewalk or grass or anything like that There s a sidewalk Hey his mind has invented a sidewalk What else is there a tree behind it or anything is there anything What kind of tree Are there leaves on the tree Are they green or are they fall Hey isn t it fun Your brain is just like it s like that s what it is That s what it s got to be And I wonder why I think I think it s a mixture of what we saw when we learned the words even as little kids Like I think that is somewhere in there still And then I think you you build on that and there are scenes from movies But there are all sorts right There are people in front of all sorts of trees I think Forest Gump has got us like kinda screwed up here Forest Gump was was is the woman sitting on the bench So that s amazing Isn t it amazing that I can say something so like just a few words And then we all are having a prior distribution over our imagination landscape Based on a movie Mm hmm affirmative Nice Nice Nice What is it called again Availability heuristic Okay I so I think of it from a statistical perspective Which means which is I I think I think we are saying the same thing but I am just adding unnecessarily medical language to it for no reason at all Just to make it annoying for people Yeah but I imagine that we have you know like our imagination has some generative model Have you seen Gans You know Generative adversarial networks They produce fake images of people that aren t real Oh Okay After we re like chatting you should go home and then check out type GANS Or like or go to work or whatever But type GANS in the internet But anyway so last thing we ll talk we ll talk about Um so these GANS what they do is they produce images by training something that tries to detect it s called discriminator It detects if the images are real or not And then you have a generator that generates fake images And it gives it real images too So now it has to decide real or fake Real or fake And as soon as you can confidently trick it into thinking that the images are real then you ve successfully a GAN that will generate realistic looking images You just have to have a really good discriminator People are good discriminators right We can say real or fake real or fake So if you gave us a ton of images you could eventually train the thing that s giving you to give you realistic images Cause it would know every time it screws up we would let it know It s sort of like reinforcement learning mixed with deep learning But anyway so I imagine that our minds are generating these these these imaginations right And we have priors over our generation models And our priors are based on like movies and things that we grew up with And so whenever you if someone just says something you actually already have pre built priors that are just sort of generating things for you Without you even meaning to before you have like your life data add on to it Exact same thing Um fake like you generate pixels Like a 2 D map of RGB values and then you have so that s the generator And then you have a discriminator it s a game back and forth and the discriminator is literally going to say that map of pixels is real or fake But we got to end it here because somebody is coming down the stairs Okay thanks guys And you hit the button the left one

constitute as sh shoes Yes Oh no Hmm no watches Laughs Laughs Mm hmm affirmative Um it s a Contigo water bottle I don t know much about it it s just it s a water bottle laughs Uh it s blue Just water Yeah so um it s more of a transparent bottle um but you can see just by the line uh from the liquid um especially from the motion where it is Um so it s kind of right at like 22 ounces of water there Laughs Well wouldn t okay So wouldn t this constitute wouldn t this constitute as the frame and this would be more of like the holder to the glass Like would that still constitute as the frame Laughs Yeah Laughs We re just being really nitpicky laughs That s an umbrella Depends on what you are focusing on so I would say in my opinion if I had to define a color it would be black though with colored accents Um so it s multicolored but I think the defining color would be black Polka yeah Looks like a cabinet or not a cabinet a dresser of some sort laughs This It s white kinda silvery Yeah It s a painting of a tree here looks like it s in the fallish time Um yeah it s got some yellows and reds and oranges in it Uh Oh it s leaning up against the wall but you can actually kind of see when you move the helmet um that there is a yoga mat um behind it as well So it s kinda leaning up against that It s to the left of the helmet Yeah looks like a hat holder of some sort Is it okay Yeah Yeah Okay How is how laughs How appropriate does this need to be Appropriate laughs Okay Okay laughs Blooming Summer Colorful Have This Very Very laughs They To World The better laughs Okay laughs Video game when I m Well I I consider video game one laughs Yeah Run when I laughs You and me both laughs Okay Oh gosh Okay And three still still three words Okay laughs The leading commissioner laughs That was a tough one Period laughs laughs Okay So so what about fall that you like though Mm hmm positive Yeah Yeah I feel like spring is more of a nomenclature rather than actual like physical changes in the weather So like I love fall especially cause um I played soccer and that was like the beginning of the season for me But I love spring because it s kinda like when you ve gone through this phase of winter and being cold and miserable It s like yes it s going to get better So for me it s like this revival of like life where s there s flowers and rain and it s not as cold Um but I definitely like fall because it s warmer and it s less rainy Yeah Warmth Yes Like that seasonal depression is just gone like you don t yeah laughs Yeah totally Right You re sweating Yeah So let me ask you so my birthday is in the spring though So I think that s partially why I like I get excited I don t know I m like one of those few people that like get excited about my birthday When is your guy s birthdays Are they in the fall Okay So So I feel like there has to be some relationship with that It s crazy so I ve noticed um even just on like um social media like uh a lot of people are already getting excited about the season ahead of where you re at So like in the wintertime people are like oh I can t wait until spring And then spring s like I can t wait until summer break and then it s summer now and people are like I can t wait until fall Like pumpkin spice lattes and all that weird stuff so it s really funny that like I feel like people are always looking forward to the next season Instead of really enjoying and soaking up what they are in laughs Right yeah Right laughs Yeah Yeah It depends on though like what each season consists of So like even with winter people get to see their family especially if people are at school and yeah it s cold but there s the holidays and that brings a lot of people together Um but with summer there s no school going on um it s warmer Here it s a lot cooler compared to like the mid west where it s like just sweaty and miserable So like that s one aspect of summer that sucks but you also don t have any classes going on and then I get more freedom with what you want to do as well so laughs About your season Have you had uh any of the shakes from Molly Moons I haven t had them but they re supposed to be really good You should try them Not that I ve had one laughs So Yeah Like a protein shake Throw some in there yeah Mm hmm positive laughs Yeah So mine s sorry if I m interrupting So mine s very similar so I love like protein shakes like love them Um and so there s this new place um that has like protein shakes that I go to and they have this like uh chocolate peanut butter cup like flavor and I love chocolate and peanut butter And that s like literally I can t get enough of it and I ve spent way too much money on getting them so I m totally like a pure ally when it comes to chocolate and all that really good healthy stuff So yeah Yeah yeah I don t have a blender though in our apartment So Yeah that s true Did you I need I should have brought mine laughs Is it the carbonation Or Yeah Well but that s so explicit though he s watching the process of what you re like trying to trick him So if you literally just colored the water to look like soda And it wasn t actually dark Yes laughs So do yo like the darker sodas or do you like like orange Cause if I were to drink soda I love orange Yeah Yeah Mm hmm positive Well the thing is though the more you talk about the more that the imagination expands So if you were to imagine a woman in the park snap for me like sorry we don t have to stop at this but like I just imagine the woman and then the bench that she s sitting on And that s it I don t imagine like this massive environment Her legs laughs She Her her dog because she would have a dog Yes she has a dog Brown What kind of dog German shepherd because I love them laughs He s just sitting being a good boy No he s he s like propped up he s sitting he s he s keeping watch for mom Um he s just looking straight but he s being aware of his environment Alert He s a german shepherd He s very alert But OK the thing is thought like when I first picture this I literally just imagined two things the woman and the bench But then when you asked start asked questions then I like I have these heuristics of what I want to imagine So like for me it s very relatable to my personality I have a german shepherd and that s what I would like imagine first but that s not like when it comes to like basic like simple environments so that s I have three yeah Right right Yeah laughs laughs So yeah Vague So what you re describing and what we ve literally just done is uh I come from a psychology background And that is known as the availability heuristic So whatever is the most readily available in terms of our like schemas of the world is what we mention So like when you mention a person on a bench you saw the stroller and that s the most available thing because that s what you are used to seeing so often So yeah To put a name to it Availability heuristic Mm hmm affirmative Different crosstalk laughs Mm mm negative Mm mm negative No Look it up Okay Mm hmm affirmative Right Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Yeah that s literally like just another way of saying that That s crazy like You have yeah you have no we ll at the end of the day yeah Like yeah it s the same thing But like you have different like reasoning behind it Um but yeah it s really fascinating that you have that kind of Yeah,True,vid_121__day_4__con_1__person_3,False,False,day_4__con_1,True,False,False
122,day_4__con_2,1,2,curtis,male,1474,2484,True,Yeah true Okay well you can chill Sit down with me Um so what we did last time is talked about um things that we re wearing that we have in common Okay So the reason I m sitting like this is so that you can see my shoe Um not that I enjoy sitting like this that much And I m trying to be like a Dr Phil or something But yeah So what what are we wearing that we all have in common Yeah but you guys We have buttoned shirts I m not sure if we all three actually have anything I can t see your feet Oh you got flip fl Sandals Umm Well I have a belt on Okay uh Yeah I guess we might actually have nothing We all have glasses actually And we all have hair and teeth laughter laughter Oh yeah that s true Um okay cool So another question about something that we re wearing Just pick some article of clothing that one of us is wearing and describe it And I know I m looking at you more but it s for everybody So I ll go first okay Um you re wearing a white shirt that says uh Oculus on it And it s just a regular t shirt laughter You looked I think you re a bit nervous but you looked like you were planning something big because you were like You re wearing green sneakers laughter I thought it was hilarious Yeah um Yeah true What about what do you think Yeah it s quite challenging with music playing How come when you re at a party or something the music doesn t bug you that much Yeah it kinda does bug me too but we hafta do it It s like we get a bunch of people in a room we gotta play some loud music so we all shout over it laughter Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah No it s not Yeah it was pretty intense So the thing I m worried about actually is that with the music and us we have like recording devices right I m wondering if it ll be super hard to pick you up I don t know yet We ll find No no just do your thing And the thing is actually it s weird you know you think Oh well you shouldn t be talking about the dataset you re recording as you re recording it But that s totally natural language It s like that s what we do That s what I talk about That s who I am Okay let s talk about some objects in the room Um I wanna go I m gonna start out I m gonna pick one and then ask you guys questions about it And I m gonna go to this guy up here because I ve never done it before Okay well actually first what are these Stairs yeah Pretend that you are an AI agent who knows nothing Okay Well you know the answers but you wanna teach an AI agent who knows nothing so I ll ask the dumbest questions ever Dumb in the sense of that you just don t have pre knowledge Okay so what are these called Average height stairs And what are they made out of And color Okay and um How many stairs are there Do you count the floor at the top of the stairs as part of the stairs Yeah nice Okay uh what is this called I think it s real You can taste it and find out laughter Uh it s not a money tree A money tree is small They re smaller Well I don t know I grew up with what we called a money tree but you may have grown up with a different sort of tree called a money tree Yeah this is amazing So this wood how would you describe the pattern of the wood I think braid is awesome Yeah weave is good too Forced or natural I dunno It looks perfect Yeah I really have no idea I dunno if this is one plant or four plants It s four right At the base Yeah There s a tree in India that is like many miles wide It takes up Its sheer volume is some number that I won t say because this is being recorded and I would be wrong But it s ridiculous okay Yeah so what it does is it it goes up okay and it makes a very wide canopy then saplings go down into the ground sprout new trees and they go out farther So you get a whole forest it s one tree Crazy Yeah Okay let s get out of this corner Just because of the it s like hard to see everything Okay So I ve asked about this place mat a hundred times What s another thing Okay okay tell me about uh tell me what is this called That s pretty good Glass cabinet Display cabinet Um can you tell me what the object is oh wait uh and what are each of these sort of glass things called Like Okay and what s on the top shelf of the glass cabinet They are called succulents You know your succulents laughter Nice No that s good Um so the second shelf from the top and it s funny if I just say second shelf you assume I mean from the top because I picked this self shelf first That s just uh prior conversation knowledge that we just pick up Anyway but so the second shelf from the top uh can you describe what sits on it Vases Um that s Nice And uh are they all uh the same size And is it just taller or is it also wider Yeah what color would you describe the three vases Good I think that was great I wasn t sure what you were gonna say cause I have no idea laughter Um okay and which is you said the tallest was on the left Where is the smallest Um there s only three so that tells us the middle one Cool Okay uh so third shelf from the top Can you tell me what is the object on the right It s a little hat box For a little hat It is I don t know the purpose Yeah It s uselessly small And the one down there is even worse but Yeah and to the left of the hat box Succulent in a It looks like a geode Maybe it is just a rock I m not sure Like a rock bowl Yeah Yeah I can t either It just has that look of like a rock that got cut the inside out like a geode Um cool And what color is the hat box Yeah gray And what color is the succulent Super No it s good I like it It s very accurate Um okay so fourth row from the top or first row from the bottom What sits on it Yeah so the first shelf from the bottom Is it the same color as the previous hat box There is a third one It s over there And there s a helmet on top of it What were you going to say Yeah Okay and what s on the bottom shelf Nice And uh what else I m gonna add another song real quick Tell me about the board game Have you guys ever played I ve never played For like hours late into the night It s always late at night I feel like it takes forever to finish a game Um okay try to fight the music Which is horribly distracting I kind of want to go over here to get slightly away from it Um okay Let s chill on the couches So last time we talked about things we like Let s talk about things we like but this time not drink or season Uh what is your favorite place and why Yeah Oh wait actually Can you guys switch the way you re sitting laughter Yeah yeah yeah yeah There s a reason why Because I think the music situation I think it ll be better Yeah exactly So you ll be farther away and then She anyway yeah Um okay so wait what was the question So favorite city Or favorite place It can also be place It doesn t have to be a city Yeah I mean okay it s not a reflection on you It s not like Oh I have to pick like the best one Yeah Yeah I mean I like a lot of places I ll pick an arbitrary place I went to this is not my favorite at all but I went to Stockholm in the summer And it was extremely chill and relaxing and nice to be there I wouldn t necessarily want to like be there forever I wouldn t choose it as like my place to be in forever But it was a really like nice and chill It was for a conference But it s it s really nice It was I d never been there It was neat Yeah Yeah Nice I mean I know my favorite place is definitely Paradise Landing Mount Rainier I just think I think it s actually the most beautiful place on Earth But I ve never been I ve never been anywhere like it It s it s completely it s so crazy There s just nothing like it It is a magical world And there s yeah I mean I ve hiked all over the world Like Yeah And you just go up like a mile and just walk around that area and it s nothing but beautiful wildflowers and the greenest grass you ve ever seen and the crazy massive Mount Rainier with the mountains in the background Ice and snow and waterfalls and rivers and like beautiful marmots walking around and goats it s just like okay This is great Yeah laughter Yeah Do you know what the shack is Or like what it s for Yeah Could be like a porta potty laughter Yeah It s Nice Wait okay you guys wanna play cards for a little bit Just like five minutes Question blackjack or poker Or another three player game that you can think of But I just know blackjack and poker Those are good for three players True Wait is there a card game you know how to play It s no reflection on yourself right It s just like some people don t play cards and some people do I ve played cards way more making this dataset than ever before Yeah yeah wait let s do blackjack then It s the simplest Yeah so that s worth ten points and you wanna get 21 As close to 21 as possible and um Yeah you say Hit or uh stay Yeah so do you wanna go first You get to check your other card No no it s okay Yeah but you leave the we get to see what you have because it makes the game fun for us Just the one card Leave it just like that It s just the way that it was Yep Perfect Pass Okay Okay so it s stay and stay Pass is uh Poker yeah okay Okay so I m I m going to hit Uh it s one or eleven I m gonna go ahead and hit again And Got what Cause this goes in the sum too I m gonna hit again Okay all right So now you show your cards And then you show yours Okay and then I show mine Okay So uh you won And I busted And you were close So you guys both had great hands All right So winner gets to keep the cards The person with the most at the end wins Okay so hit or stay Okay so now You flip So you guys have both gotten exceptional hands like every time Um I m intentionally busting Because I know you ll have perfect hands So for me it s nothing to lose Like um yeah Does it make sense Uh also it s not fair that uh you go first every time It s not fair because I get more information before I have to uh make my decision to hit Um but yeah okay So it doesn t really matter that much but it s slightly less fair Okay this time Oh this time you you go first All right So I ll deal the same way Oh sorry And uh you go first Pass Gosh it s stay but that s okay Um I ll hit Oh Good for you She shows first And you had another great hand Uh I busted All right You guys are just uh just killing it Whoops Lemme shuffle that guy I did Beginner s luck That s what it s all about All right so I go first I ll hit I ll hit Um I ll hit Okay All clubs really Okay Okay Oh yeah Okay All right now I show first So I busted Who won I dunno how much Oh that s 21 This is like uh this is absolutely ridiculous This is now how the other games have gone Oh sorry sorry Did it flip All right and it s gonna do that way You re like did you see what she did She was like She was going to give it back to me and then realized it was a jack and was like I m going to keep that All right so you go first this time Hit Stay How do you always get these great hands to start Okay I m going to stay All right what chu got Okay It s like making me want to give up my my job and I wanna be your sponsor and we ll go to we ll go to Las Vegas together Uh So mixing these up a little bit You re supposed to reshuffle every time Oh it s okay All right Um so hit or stay laughter Hit or stay Okay I m gonna stay too And now you reveal Oh nice Dealer wins All right so that s poker You guys are both way better than I am I ll never play poker against you Oh blackjack thank you Blackjack And I will never uh never play against you with real money Um so that s it And now we press this on the

hmm affirmative Mmm hmm affirmative Yeah laughter Yeah uh so Tricia I really like your jacket especially cause in discovery it s super cold but it s like this nice tan beige color um and it s got buttons on it And then you have um a really cute like black top underneath it looks like Yeah Yeah Really Yeah like the awkwardness laughter Yeah well I think too when you re at a party like people tend to be drinking and they re closer together and they re already just naturally speaking louder Um so I think people because of the distraction and the noise in the background you tend to be more focused on the conversation because you re trying to cut out that extra information in the background But also I feel like the quality of the conversation isn t as good so like if I were yelling at you Tricia and I m like trying to keep this conversation going and the music was even louder we would mishear each other a lot and we would tend to be like Yeah like and like that s all our responses would be Like you know what I m talking about Yeah Yeah yeah And they ask you a question and you re like Uh huh and you have no idea like what they re talking about Mmm hmm affirmative laughter laughter Yeah laughter Cool Okay These are stairs It s a nice little small staircase and it s like the first half of a staircase Um and it s interesting so stairs have different heights as well so some are very very short um but then some are very tall Um but these are like probably a good average um for example Yeah Uh it looks like wood Um but they can be made of anything Um I would call that like a light tan laughter It s how many steps you have to take is what I would define it so one two three four five six seven Is it real laughter Risk it laughter The weaves Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative Yeah I wanna say it was trained so as the growth came about I wanna say that they tied them in certain ways to cause that curvature um right there Um because it s rare I feel like it s rare to see a plant that s weaved so perfectly with one another cause I mean is this considered one Or are these multiple plants that are weaved together Yeah Yeah Holy cow Interesting Yeah Yeah Shelves They re succulents Yeah So they re like in their own little bowls that are like sitting in a single tray all together They re so cute I love succulents Yeah I mean not that well but I mean I got a cactus for my birthday one time but laughter Yeah Mm hmm affirmative I was just gonna say the same thing So they re decorative vases is how I would say it but I know some people say vase Vases Yeah They do Mm hmm affirmative I think it s pretty proportional so as you get bigger they get taller and wider Um I think even like at the top there s differences in how wide they are Cream It s a good color yeah Yeah I was going to say a crackled off white But yeah cream was Yeah laughter laughter Yeah Little bitty hat It s very small Yeah Looks like a rock Well what constitutes a geode for you Is it the little crystals inside I can t see any so Yeah Green With little bitty tips of like this reddish purple color Looks like Or brown I just named three colors but laughter laughter Yeah It looks lighter but Yeah laughter Oh yeah so it looks lighter but it s because of the lighting So like this one right here is behind the shadow of the plant so it looks darker just from like a picture perspective than this one but they re definitely the same color I ve never played Catan Have you Oh laughter Yeah it looks like it s like um like a real life scenario of like how to like start or like um kind of settle new land This is based on the trade build and settle kind of wordage So I m guessing like you start new land you re settling there and you re building new houses and buildings and then you to yeah And trade Yeah laughter Uh uh negative laughter Yeah Yeah Do you mean like part of the US or like place in your home like Yes Oh okay So it s easier to hear me since I have speaker or like audio on my glasses But you don t Yeah Okay that was the question Okay Like Miss America answer Like you have to have like the perfect response Uh huh affirmative Was it for vacation Or Okay Awesome Yeah So I have two places Um this is such a cliché thing to say but I went for I presented at a workshop in Paris And that was just like star striking for me Like it was just amazing Like awesome place Um everything there Like I walked there the whole time and it was really awesome Um and then like in terms of like locally um where I went to college um that college town like feel um has a really awesome vibe and I definitely miss that It s where I met my fiancé and so um that kind of like has some more significant meaning to me Um but yeah it s awesome Yeah so what defines like your favorite place Is it food I think that s a big influence Yeah Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Right next to you yeah laughter Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Is it like a ranger station maybe Or something like that laughter Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Yeah I went there uh a couple weekends ago and it was awesome Really cool Sure Go Fish laughter Okay Right Without going over Yeah okay so this is adding onto the ace right Oh yeah Sorry I don t really remember Okay so these are the cards that I m like using that I want to get to 21 Oh okay So Just the one that you had open Okay Okay Um pass Oh stay yeah Stay Yeah okay What You got it right You got 21 Oh Okay Okay Okay Yeah Yeah laughter Uh stay I flip Okay laughter laughter Busting yeah Mm hmm affirmative Right laughter It s okay Um I ll hit too laughter Okay now do I Okay I think I busted too Yeah You fixed these hands didn t you laughter I ll hit laughter Okay I ll stay Twenty wait 21 laughter laughter No laughter I ll keep it I see that Under the table work there laughter Okay Mm hit Yeah Stay I busted Nice laughter laughter Right Oh do you want my cards too Hmm I m gonna hit Stay Busted Nice Blackjack That was blackjack laughter laughter

different starter Like besides that I just think it s a it s not good to We could do that but then but then it someone might be like oh like that s what they eat for breakfast I don t know Yeah Yeah Um okay so right We re all wearing tennis shoes Yeah What else Anything else in common We all have socks That s it And glasses right How do you feel about the music in the background Oh yeah Yeah I think it s feels very odd Okay Um all right Let s talk about some objects Let s talk about these pillows So first of all I just said what they re called but what are they what is the blue thing on the couch called Yes And what color is it I think it s greenish blue It s kinda teal aqua All right What do you call the pillow to the left of that pillow It s light blue right Post lunch I feel like Sleepy Yeah we did Oh maybe toss it to me This is actually a better way to do um yeah the where we say the words ya know Let s just jump into that now So uh we ll make sentences It should be about pillows I Pillows And Again Oh what d you say again Again Okay Back and forth again Okay Um um Soft Pillows Laughter Cotton Are This Bad Okay alright the pillow is a distraction Okay great Alright let s go to the center and and finish off with no pillow So let s see what word to use this time What It s loud yeah it s much louder Yeah it s distracting I m worried it s too loud Yeah I don t know It might not be possible No I m gonna leave it I m gonna let it be okay Okay um so oh yeah Uh yeah What is it We re trying to get it down we re trying to That works Okay Okay so we re gonna talk about the table What is this called It s quite cold Coaster yeah but it s very cold Yeah Um okay They re made of stone Yeah Nice Um yeah Okay so what s this called Uh this is a plate Or a bowl How about a plate bowl It s definitely a plate with high edges And what is it on top of On top of I think it s a tray Yeah I would call this a tray Potentially a wooden place mat It s kind of hard Well a place mat actually might qualify unfortunately Okay what s this called How many forks are on the table What s this called How many spoons are on the table And what s this called inaudible okay what color is the fork What color is the knife And what color is the spoon Okay is this knife to the left or right of this spoon laughter very good And uh is this coaster to the right or to the left of the fork Okay say the whole sentence Say the coaster is to the blank to the fork Yeah Okay good stuff Um how many fingers do I have on the table laughter alright and then last thing Um wait have we named everything on the table Is there anything on the table that we don t know what it s called I think we re good right Alright is the uh what tell me about the location of the objects So the bowl is on top of what Yeah The tray The tray And the tray is on top of what What color is the table What color is the tray What color is the coaster And the coaster is on top of the Good And what is underneath the table Four chairs and a rug What color is the rug And what color are the chairs Nice Okay Alright Enough of that Okay let s talk about something interesting So the question is you want to get to space okay Yes I do come up with these Um like in my spare time Uh the question is we want to get to space inaudible in air astro Okay alright And we want to do it as energy efficient as possible There are four options And and our goal in terms of being in space is to do experiments So we just need to carry equipment equipment isn t super crazy heavy Let s say the equipment weighs like a 100 pounds okay Um there are four options to get to space One is to launch like a rocket like when we see some companies doing these days successfully Another is balloons so we raise a balloon really high and hope it doesn t pop Another option is uh using some kind of UAB type device but just imagine like a uh sort of um like solar panel flying device that can you know glide and get higher and higher and higher Um of course there are limits to this because of the density of the atmosphere Okay And then the fourth option is to build a ladder My question to you is which do you recommend and why Yeah I care about time and expense So I want to do it as fast and cheaply as possible Yeah Yeah so I don t actually know of any solar UAB that can stay in the air with any kind of weight for more than a minute with weight I mean if it has no weight on it it can stay in the air for a really long time Yeah so even I can barely hear you with the music I m gonna turn it down one more notch Not super well Is that better How about this Is that a good amount laughter okay alright so um Nice Um would you all know anything about UABs Don t avoid mentioning like any company specifically but I know that there s a company working on like very wide paneled UABs that had solar paneling and that goal is to like be up there for a very long time right And then there are balloons that float uh ideally these things are providing internet And um yeah so a lot of people are doing this kind of stuff but they re not in space They re in the stratosphere Is that the right word This is not my area Yeah But here s the disclaimer here is that there is as far as I know this is none of our expertise Like I know nothing about what I m asking about um Really so like locally or like really low level right You re working on the circuits Yeah Um okay so let me think about it So the ladder is like a lot of people have proposed this by the way You can look it up on Wikipedia Yeah yeah And you just keep like build it up and like raise higher and higher um it s not a crazy it is crazy Yeah so here s another idea We launch a spaceship that has a rope attached to earth Okay so when it launches it s not attached it could be attached actually I don t know it d be difficult but what we try to do is ideally we just want to like okay two options One is launch a spaceship and somehow it it releases something as it s launching that is really fire resistant and you know what I m circulating a lot And that gets hooked onto something on the earth And also hooked onto something that is in stable orbit Meaning that it doesn t pass the earth Yeah synchronous orbit So now we have like a cord attached And also we have to like make sure no planes like ever fly And all these crazy ideas but say that you did this Well I don t know I mean that s the idea You could maybe have two ropes and they d go in a pulley fashion I don t know Yeah Cause the other weight on the rope is pulling it down Half the weight is gravity s pulling it down while half the weight is being pulled up No there has to be the weight so there s a weight Right And if you add a weight One man or woman could stand on earth and pull assuming no friction Okay But now here s the issue in order to have as you say a rope strong enough to be able to stretched that high it would have to be really really good Some kind of great material Which would likely be heavy So now you have something heavy that is how many how many miles is it or kilometers to uh to uh space I have no idea Okay yeah I have no idea I don t want to claim a number without looking it up but yeah So how much does that weight right A hundred miles of rope is heavy too heavy for maybe launch I don t know Okay Yeah I m trying to think about some kind of organic substance that actually if you just put two of them together they grow to be like uniform you know And then you don t have to use any kind of glue or any hinge or anything Another idea would be you have like the rope is shaped in such a way that it s uh I m trying to think Like a chain but the chain has every link has so much force on it you know It would be distributed but yeah so like basically what I m thinking alright So if we send them up in parts and then you want to connect the parts what is a connection that can withstand this amount of tensile strength I know I don t know what contiguous means but Yeah Hmm Okay Good thoughts One more question Did we do the one with the person sitting on the bench Oh yeah Okay We ll do a slightly different one You re going into a dentist s office Alright just imagine that you re going into a dentist s office and uh you just there s there s the waiting room right Before you get in And you there s someone at the desk and you uh they hand you the form that you have to fill out like because you re at the dentist s office Can you see it Okay What color is the desk that the form was on Mine is light yellow Okay that s amazing by the way That our brains just made all those up Yeah so maybe this is what we do And the person who handed it to you was it a person you ve seen before or was it like a figment of a person Okay I don t want to discuss male female or anything like that but did the person have glasses I think mine had glasses hanging from the neck Like a yeah like a okay so also in view Can you see anything else in the office there Is it open like between you and the person who works at the desk or is there glass There s glass for me too Yeah because these dentists don t want to get sick Well the people who work there don t want to get sick But actually now that I think about it if I actually think about my dentist s office I haven t been there in some time but uh they don t have glass But there was glass Okay What about the waiting room What color is the carpeting Don t think about your dentist just think in your mind Yeah Kind of like there s a butt imprint Like it kind of sags just a little bit Alright Some coffee stains Oh okay I m gonna change position just for a minute Um what about uh does the waiting room how many couches are there And what about uh yeah this one s good This is a solid one Yeah I know Um and were there any magazines in the waiting room Nice Okay one more question So um the one on the bench I kind of want to hear what you think So there s just a there s a person sitting on the bench and they re in a park Okay You can see him What s the person wearing And what s the what s the weather in the park like what s it like It s morning time Yeah Nice That s pretty solid I think somebody

feels weird but it s it s fine Yeah I d say like teal or aqua Oh the color yeah Yeah Is it like different there s like different words for pillows right cause you say like these are we said these are like couch cushions right Is that is this what you call a throw pillow I ve actually never I m not exactly sure what a throw pillow is but I think that might be one Like Back And And Eat They Nylon A I mean we can all understand each other fine That s like the important metric we re trying to meet Okay do you want me to go turn it down Okay Were these coasters here before Okay I don t remember them they re nice coasters Coaster But it s cold I didn t know Yeah it feels thirsty It s so cold Feel how cold that is There s still a lot of heat capacity right These are fancy none of that cardboard stuff It s like it s it s like a these are like an absorbent stone like a sandstone So if you have like condensation it often like absorbs into the stone Plate Yeah it s like a plate with lips Like with large lips I don t know A cool tray It could be like a salad plate A tray yeah I don t know why I don t know why you d own these really but Yeah it s not it s definitely not a kind of mat It s not a mat I see four Four forks Spoon Also four Also silver Also silver I say it s to the right The coaster is to the right of the fork 5 Now you have four Three You have four fingers on the table The place mat Let s call it a tray The table is brown Light brown Tan Four chairs and a rug Yellow White Those are very conflicting concerns In terms of like like I should also ask like how much re usability you want right Assuming your ladder does last it s gonna be really hard to make that ladder but once you have it there it s gonna be relatively cheap just to you know keeping monies and energies to send more and more cargo up right Yeah I guess that it doesn t require fuel then yeah I mean you could distribute the weight Like how many UABs would you need if you wanted to like you know I mean let s say you want to bring one kilogram into space You probably have like 500 UABs Strapped to some You re speaking kind of quietly but it s fine It s it s quieter I think stratosphere You only get to like that density is when you re like a few times less than it is here All those things are requiring some sort of buoyancy or air to push off of There s like the space elevator idea right The crazy part is that you need like really strong tensile strength right So if you get it high enough then you have somewhere to just like the centripetal force of the earth will hold it up right If you have a weight really far away in orbit around the earth the idea is that farther than stable orbit then it wants to fly away and you re roped he wants to fall down and so they sort of balance each other out Synchronous orbit Oh god laughter You know I think this is something people have talked seriously about I think the the main problem is just you don t have materials that strong Yeah so the idea is that once you have the rope there it s relatively cheap to send cargo along this rope Yeah Yeah but pulling the rope doesn t take so much energy so so if you have a circulator or a counter weight An energetically neutral motor so if there s no weight on the rope then you can just rotate without any energy except for friction Friction is all it will take Mm hmm affirmative It s far A hundred or something Well to lower to synchronous orbit I think it s it s like several hundred at least You can talk about you can send it up in chunks and stuff like you know Have a bunch of missions that add up to some satellite and you re just bringing up like 100 feet at a time But the bigger issue is like as you make it you know stronger so it can support all that weight you re making it thicker again so that it becomes heavier so that it needs to become stronger So there s just not a material that can do it right now Period No matter how thick you made it because the stronger you make it the heavier it gets Fancy Like a chain That d be a problem a pretty contiguous material could right I mean like I mean like not like just one long strand one fiber right Oh I haven t done that one Mm hmm affirmative Gray Well I was picturing my dentist s office right I think so Mm hmm affirmative There s glass My dentist has glass The carpet ugh Yeah No like let s picture your dentist s office you re picturing like you know you have like the nice warm yellow lamp in the corner and like all the tacky magazines that you read or like no one actually reads them right Um and like an aging old couch to sit on That s like too firm Yeah yeah Yeah The kind you see at like your grandma s house No They re usually super hygienic in that sense Like the surfaces are all wiped down But there s definitely some like splotches of color on the couches Was anyone reading them Like a fairly warm brown jacket um jeans So it s sort of like the fresh like chilly morning Yeah Like I m picturing this like as a guy like a little older went for like his like morning walk to get some like fresh air inaudible good for his constitution Yeah And like he sees people around him that are being more active like running or walking dogs and stuff but he s like totally content to not be doing that just to be there in the morning at like 7 AM breathing in that nice fresh

127,day_4__con_4,1,3,curtis,male,1235,2494,True,Okay we already did the I think we ve done the clothes thing enough times Um so let s just jump into talking about objects in the room Okay So I m gonna describe an object then you guys can too I m just gonna ask you questions about it So what is this this object right here called And what color is uh what is this part of the mirror called The frame the mirror frame Uh what color is the mirror frame What color is the mirror Is it laughs laughs Yeah is a is a mirror silver Is it Oh okay Is it really I don t know how mirrors I don t know what Okay I mean definitionally it is not the color silver because in order to be the color silver you have to reflect everything except for silver I think I think silver has a reflective property to it But what is shiny Shiny is reflectivity right So and We ve transitioned from talking about objects in the room to the ideation of crosstalk Oh the fork Yeah okay Let s do it The mirror has no color You agree right There there is no silver at all visible Except for what s reflected the mirror is only the color of us Oh so your there s Is it I feel like the fridge is not reflective It s stretching the light But what about I m not sure that we can associate reflectivity with uh silver I think glass has no silver in its reflective But the soft laughing in background but when we talk about reflective so I mean when we think about color what is color Color is help us out Color is just the it s literally what you reflect right Is it not It s the spectrum of light that s given off when an object is hit by But but but what inaudible about white light So if you hit an object with white light which means it has full spectrum of UA of like hertz of ultraviolet radiation Not ultraviolet um what is it Yeah this whatever the wave is called Plutonic wavelength Thank you electromagnetic radiation across the spectrum of wave lengths that represents visible light hits an object alright Now that something about the properties of that object which I have not studied and now I feel stupid talking about this considering I haven t studied it and it seems like something we should all know When the lights hit the object only say red comes back and now the object s red Everything else is absorbed except for red Why I don t know Do you know why I have no idea I really don t know Don t embarrass yourself Right So now something that s reflective Okay Okay so what is that what is the perceptive appearance So maybe okay maybe maybe we re saying the same thing but I ve always thought of shiny as the at the atomic structure it is more ordered Which means the surface is technically smoother but really it just means that the pattern by which the atoms are actually structured together is uh more patterned less random That s the way I ve always thought of it But this is like my Sorry not atoms um molecular At the molecular level Yeah Oh That s brilliant okay so if you shine That s great so if you shine a blue light on this wall and I see the blue circle and you re saying it s diffused in the sense that the material when the light hits the light it goes it gets just like randomly reflecting in all directions Why so so sure but why so and then the opposite would be a mirror where it reflects exactly and at say whatever angle it hit on the opposite Okay But but here s the thing that tricks me up both of them the light gets reflected outward so regardless of the direction how come the direction is the only difference and yet in one way it s all together going in one direction meaning that it s reflective like a mirror And the other way it s diffused and so it s going in all directions Why is it going in all directions let me see the light Why do I see it coming into my eyes Because I m standing you know over here and the light is bouncing in all directions So it is coming at me okay So that just means that I can pick it up and then I see Mmmmmm acknowledging So that s why the intensity of the light reflected off the mirror would be so much stronger Or if someone shines a light in your eyes it s so much stronger than if they shine the light on the wall and you look at it Then it s not it doesn t hurt your eyes at all Brilliant Okay so now this makes me think of Yeah Let s sorry to interrupt you but I wanna get the audio Okay alright what were you saying Shiny okay alright cool So are you familiar with uh I think it s okay I mean we talk about cars everybody drives cars You know the Prius It s a pretty common car So if you ever notice the light shines there s a there s a stick that says you know drive reverse And there s a light I don t know what model but one of the models maybe not the newest there s light that shines from the top at night onto like the drive steering It doesn t light up and most cars would light up Like the actual steering thing lights up they light up with like a blue light Uh so there s a light that shines from the top of the car down onto like the driving the stick that lets you adjust whether the car s in drive or reverse or neutral And there s that stick you know with your right hand if you re driving on the left side of the car So the light s shining on that on this uh stick I just call it the trans er the um stick shift but it s not a stick shift because it s an automatic car It s not a gear shift either Because it s an automatic car so I don t know what the name is for that Okay sure the prindle laughter but yeah so there s the thing you change from reverse to drive and there s a light that shines on it okay Now what you d ex what you d anticipate is that if you were going to get into a brand new car and you ve never seen how they do it you d assume at night time it would just light the handle up so you can see you know this is reverse this is drive and they would just have like lights everywhere So at night time you could see it But they don t do it that way Instead they shine it from the top and I just always thought naturally hey that s great because because they re shining it from the top it doesn t look super bright in my eyes while I m driving And it s because it s diffused So when I look at it the intensity of the light reflecting back at me is not that strong because it s reflecting everywhere so I m only getting a little bit of it Versus if they just had lights on there that were just super bright when I look down on it it would be coming directly from the source that wouldn t have had a chance to scatter first and it would be stronger Not that they couldn t like use less light but then how much light to use I don t know maybe it s not the best example but it is an example crosstalk of diffusion to try to like shine things from a different angle Wait you can do what Make shadows Oh yeah It comes straight down on on on to the Yeah so you can see it Okay Um right so we never actually talked about objects in the room but that s okay maybe we ll just skip it for this this this round Because this is so far the conversation is is great laughing Let s talk about one more topic and then maybe play some cards So the last topic is um have we have we done the person sitting on the bench Did we do last time did we do the person sitting on the bench Oh maybe this is new okay Yeah let s do let s do it again and I m gonna ask different questions So there s a there s a person sitting on a bench Alright In the park Can you see him You got an image in your head Okay What is directly in front of that person So they re on the bench what s in front of their feet Grass Awesome What is it for you A stone path And how s what s the stone path look like Concrete It s a concrete sidewalk I imagine that the the the bench was actually on the sidewalk So their feet were not on the grass but they re on the sidewalk And the sidewalk extends you know maybe like seven feet that way and then goes on to wherever to wherever Where does it go Can you see it or is it just a sidewalk that ends in your imagination It s okay it doesn t have to go anywhere I don t know I don t know Yeah Right nice So there s a playground scene and kids playing And the slide Are there two swings Or what are the swings like Yeah I wouldn t sit on that single swing if I saw one crosstalk I know I would definitely wonder Okay and what else What about you how far out could you see beyond the bench Huge Just like huge Okay nice So I always imagine it too and yet I ve been to almost no parks like this But when I think of a park and I just imagine in my head I see like almost kind of rolling hills of green I mean definitely what s happening is we have a prior distribution over our generative model of our imagination We do and our prior has been determined by media And it s interesting Yeah yeah And we ll get away from that topic because uh we don t want But but yeah no no I know you laughing I just mean um like yeah It s interesting just to think about how the mind works in that sense But yeah let s play some cards We ll do some quick card game I m gonna sit on the couch this time cause I ve never gotten to sit on the couch I m quite chilly myself Alright so are you familiar with black jack Or poker which would you like to play You ve got a general idea of poker Would you rather play poker or blackjack Either what about you I d rather play poker laughs Alright so we re going to play typical five card so you get to pass in three cards and you know what the hands are So the getting two of the same number that s the sort of easiest goal and then and then and you get more you re more likely to win if you have uh something that s less probable So if you have two pair that s even better You discard up to three card shuffling Yeah yeah I ll I ll give you it So I m gonna get rid of two and draw two like this On the reflection Oh no I can t believe y all saw my cards laughing That s not fair Okay discard pile And three for you One two three Yeah I m sure yeah Ummm Nice Alright I m going to bet one card You can bet Okay um so what do you have High card ace What do you have A pair of jacks I have a pair of nines High card queen you beat me Alright so that ll be our discard pile I m gonna keep some you keep some and we ll use it for our betting Okay so the this is not real betting This is just just uh yeah yeah I keep throwing the numbers Everybody has five Okay I like my hand I m gonna I m gonna throw away one And I m going to give you three Okay here you go You get some good stuff Only three You just kept your highest card Okay now let s do another round just to make it interesting So you can discard one more card Yeah Because that s convenient I have a pair of jacks and I m discarding one of the jacks I just want to see what happens Okay alright wanna do another round Half a card I will bet I ll bet all of it I have a pretty good hand How much do you bet You gotta you gotta match me if you if you Alright All of yours Alright well what do you guys got Three of a kind What What I was pretty proud of my hand Oh man I wanted that ten But I couldn t get that ten crosstalk An ace No I know it upgraded for sure but I

129,day_4__con_4,3,3,alex,male,1235,1296,False,Mm hmm affirmative It s a nice mirror laughs Frame Like fake gold Silver I d say so yeah No Literal literally it is silver like chemically right Yeah yeah it s like a made from like silver nitrate I think Yeah Yeah no like until they like developed a good method for like pouring out silver and like getting the perfect surface they couldn t make good mirrors I mean is silver a color Is that not just like gray but now it s shiny Yeah So is is is silver then like your gray and you re reflective and not as reflective as a mirror Like is that fair Yeah I m gonna bring the fork over to the mirror and we can compare them side by side There s definitely some inaudible the fork is more more silver than the mirror I agree Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah well look at my self in the fork like it s or maybe the spoon s a better instance right Th the spoon is like it reflects yourself with less less vibrance somehow than the mirror right Compare your reflection in the spoon to your reflection crosstalk 00 02 20 So it s like a dull Yeah like the silver is like its gray and shiny but less shiny than the mirror Yeah or like the fridge right It s pretty reflective But still like way more diffused than the mirror I it s it s yeah it s reflecting it but it s not like It s not like a mirror sheen by any means Yeah so I think I think I d say if I had to define silver I d say it s reflective gray But what what is given off That could be like from other Is it like all the visible Like electromagnetic waves Mm hmm affirmative Right I think I think I think I can talk about this decently So there s a few different things So there s like when light hits it it can it can absorb that completely and just you know heat up it can absorb that and like basically reflect it so give it off at some angle uh and that same wave length ummm or it can uh yeah so inaudible so you absorb it or reflect it at the same wave lengths or some things I guess can absorb it and reflect or reflect it in a different wave length Which could like can also happen Like mostly the color is given by like which things you re getting back Specular versus diffused reflection So it s specular it means it means its like a very flat surface so when it comes in at least it comes out the exact same angle Whereas if it s diffused it s like a bunch of tiny little bumps so light comes in and then which tiny little bump it s hitting makes it bounce off any which way So something that s shiny is very specular and something that s like maybe not is diffused Yeah that s pretty that s accurate yeah Yeah I think that s reasonably tr yeah I think it s like a little bit higher than atoms like tens of atoms but yeah there s like Yeah Like this wall if you shine blue light on this wall you can see the blue spot on this wall from any direction right So that means when the blue photon hits it it some bounce off into every direction Whereas like if I shined a blue light on that mirror right there I wouldn t really see it bouncing off as much right The fridge all coming off from the one direction And then there s like the fridge where like its you see sort of a vertical line right So its it s diffused in this direction so light can come in at any vertical angle and come off but it s very specular in the horizontal direction Yeah Yeah Well that s because some of it s coming at you Yeah So like like if there s a if there s one light source somewhere right if you look in a mirror you only basically see that light source at one spot in the mirror Because only one particular angle that light source will hit the mirror and come at your eyes But if we look at this wall the light source can shine all across the wall and all of them can bounce back to me Yeah because it s spread across the whole Yeah so if Yeah just like a inaudible surface fully diffused Specular is shiny Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Right Oh I haven t seen that Gea Gear shift Prindle laughs Right Mm hmm affirmative Yeah right Yeah Yeah Yeah nice I haven t seen that either yeah Oh yeah Like very very direct Nice I kind of did it last time Alright Okay Uh yeah it s like a foot or so from the bench a stone path Like a stone path that had like their feet on the grass It s like a like a like a sidewalk kind of I guess smooth like not not like cobbley I mean like just like a like a Yeah that s Yeah I as thinking of plain concrete sort of a path Like he he s sitting on grass like a foot in between the bench and his feet and like a foot of grass and then the path right Yeah I guess that also is common crosstalk Yeah Right Yeah Is that kind of like the poetry book Where the Sidewalk Ends laughing I think it s like a kids kids It feels ominous For me quite a ways So he s like got his back to like a tree so he s like in some shade but like he wants to stay cool but like across from him is a big wide open grassy region like like Yeah Like big enough I guess like a baseball field or something that like For like the kids to play like in soccer games Yeah Kind of crosstalk I feel like that s the image we get in like TV shows and like probably Central Park kind of vibe laughs Yeah Yeah we do Oh absolutely That s why like diversity in media is so important right Yeah yeah No I get you crosstalk Cool I m gonna steal this nice warm blanket Either Would you rather

There s a pot No it s quite real I think it s I don t know Yeah I think I made it a little crooked Okay so what s This is called a Plant And the color is And what is this I m not sure This is a What color is it Um what about this What color is the thing it s sitting inside crosstalk dark gray Uh nice and it s sitting on top of what And the floor is wood I mean what color is the floor Yeah nice Okay Um what do you call uh hmm that object right there Yeah it s a hamper Um You can see inside the hamper There s some objects in there And what color is the hamper It s gray It s kind of shiny right So maybe silver And the texture It s made out of what What s this called There s a name for that I just can t think of it right now Um yeah Okay and uh what is the hamper next to crosstalk And a beanbag This is true What is it What is it resting against What s the hamper resting against And what color is the couch Yeah okay And because I know you wanna talk about the beanbag what shape is the beanbag Round Round I don t know if round is a shape It s a shape property Uh Some kind of What do you call a 3 D oval What s that called It s spherical Yeah I don t know Why do we not know What is a 3 D oval Yeah I don t know the word for it A collapsed sphere Laughing Okay sure And what is the material You know the actual word for that is a love sack That s what it s actually called Yeah no I m just reading the name off the side Like I don t know that it s called that It just says it right here I ll show the camera Nice Okay uh so that s good What else Uh enough objects Okay Laughing L let s talk about let s talk about things we like that we haven t talked yet So what is um what is your favorite kind of music and why So mine s probably hip hop R B rap because I can relate to it I find it very relatable The whole point is to convey a message that usually has a lot of emotion and when I listen to music it s it is an emotional experience for me The purpose of listening to it for me is usually emotion so if I m Sometimes I listen to it wh while working but that would be I can t listen to like too It has to be something that s the emotion is literally focused emotion or like crosstalk emotion That s right Yeah Like a steady beat right Yeah But then most uh most hip hop rap is not like this right But uh that s When I m listening to it I like really listen to it I I listen to the words a lot more than I do the rhythm Maybe you enjoy learning from it Yeah Or you could say one is an extension of the other Yeah Yeah Wait What d you say before classical Oh I thought you said you like blank or classical Oh okay What about when you re working out What about when you re working out Yeah Nice That s good Okay Now your like question What is your favorite plant and why So when I was little I thought it was the Venus Flytrap just because I thought it was cool that it like eats animals laughing It eats bugs I thought it was me you know Yeah it seemed it seemed a little bit like reversal I thought it was cool Spider lilies They re pretty Yeah I agree You like grass Grass I I m just teasing Grass is pretty Grass is actually a very amazing plant It holds like the world together and it also grows everywhere and it can grow in many conditions and it makes our world very comfortable and livable It also keeps the earth cool If you ve ever walked on like uh dirt Well asphalt s been crosstalk But like rock or dirt these things are much hotter Grass is cool Yeah It s pretty nice Okay so my favorite plant is actually now probably the the inaudible It s a tree that s in India but there s also some in uh Florida and it s just a beautiful tree where the wood grows very spindly but its spikes hold and you can climb it and it creates beautiful red flowers mostly so it has like red instead of uh green for the tops Okay Favorite plant Laughing Okay so Yeah yeah something easy Okay so what s your favorite piece of technology Yeah Laughing And why It s no reflection of yourself right This is just Just something you think is neat I haven t asked this question before so without any prior thought I would just say a personal computer Yeah crosstalk because with a personal computer I can access mostly anything and then like I have access to unlimited clusters unlimited GPUs unlimited Like most things I can access to eventually through my computer It s pretty amazing so really I m harnessing I m saying like inaudible technology is an entire network internet of things is my favorite technology But actually it s just a laptop right That s the thing I have to purchase and use Yeah internet s great yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay so now the hard question and I didn t actually say yours yet but the hard question is I guess for us but if you think of your favorite piece let us know Okay And the question is for each of ours what is the component of technology within the object you described that you think is you know the one that you like the most So I would say inside of a computer the component is probably like that I think is the most useful is probably the CPU but that s like not really that interesting Actually mother b boards are pretty impressive these days They handle a ton of things Uh and screens are really good now too Actually keyboards are really good now too but yeah the CPU I mean you can t really do much without a really good low level circuitry and CPU Yeah What do think about Well the compressor in the refrigerator I m not sure if that s like what you think is cool but it s definitely Oh yeah but for a fridge I d say the most important piece is The compressor technologies are pretty en en energy efficient these days Yeah Yeah they re awesome Nanoseconds Depends on how hard Yeah Okay what about satellites No all cable based It s like massive wires that run under the ocean Do they They actually run on the ocean floor right Like they re un I don t think that they re suspended The ocean is really long I think they re not mo What would they suspend from Are they floating inside the ocean Do they have a buoyancy Like are they surrounded by air that makes them sort of just float around I think they re on the ground Yeah I think they re actually on the ocean floor but they have to avoid plate tectonic issues Like what is it Divergent plates convergent plates and uh whatever this is called when they slide tectonic plates crosstalk Yeah Because like it s really deep down there So this case I mean like they have like 10 layers If you look up a fiber optic cable put in you ve seen the diagrams Yeah so But I really don t know I assume that they re on the ground crosstalk because how do you make them buoyantly like stay in a position that s stable Yeah how did they actually deploy the whole entire thing though right The whole thing Laughing It s so heavy Like how do they uh how do they actually do this Yeah I don t know What time is it Um okay Um do you all want to play a game of cards Oh yeah We can play a game of cards This time maybe we could go for poker Okay wanna play some poker Let s play in a different a different setup Is there a different way we could play Yeah Yeah we can play although I m just gonna Yeah we ll just play on the plates laughing This is very weird actually I don t feel like moving all this stuff back so I m gonna go for it This is very unusual Uh W how many what Everybody s inaudible All right I am gonna move this You can change three cards No no betting on this laughing with real things All right so that s You wanna discard three cards No I don t care This Okay Two cards for you How cards for you We should probably play this more formally for the sake of Fred actually learn from the game Um okay so um I m going to just call Well seeing that we ve all bet something so I m just going to call and you can bet something if you want Not something real You can bet you can bet points Call me Yeah You have to you have to call or you you say I bet 50 Or whatever We all call and then we show our cards and we there s some amount that you had to pay to enter the game and we all crosstalk Okay so you bet 100 and I fold cause my hand sucks So you call So now you show each other your cards He had a pretty good hand He should Okay good So those are all Now let s let s use these to bet So just take a hand full of them and we ll use them to bet Okay so there s a card for you Well typically we d inaudible at the end of the day Or we can uh we can call or we can Wanna do a round of betting first That s the correct way to play So before we actually do anything yeah All right so I bet 10 No I changed my mind It s too too confusing Okay Okay so now we get rid of our cards and we get rid of one and I m going to give you three And I m going to give you three crosstalk Uh and now I m going to bet again I m gonna bet 100 She goes first You call And you raised 100 I call Yeah It s 210 I bet 10 to begin with Then I raised that so 210 yeah and crosstalk and then I raised that It s 210 Okay so the person who placed the bet the last bet has to show their cards first Oh very good Nothing laughing I was laughing He had her All right Good work guys Um

focused playlist that has no words but that s got a lot of like really um theatrical sounding like electronic dance type like heavy bass kind of thing That that gets me to focus but Yeah a steady beat Yeah Mm hmm affirmative I appreciate that yeah I like artists When it comes to rap I like artists that um have a little more going on in the lyrics you know like there s telling a story of some kind or um I feel weird about this but I can almost go by like count of unique words in the lyrics The more count of unique words there are the more I m likely to enjoy it if it s not too too repetitive I do I cause I really enjoy spoken word poetry and so I I feel like rap is an extension of that put to music so I really like it crosstalk extensions of one I mean they I feel like they often If you just put spoken word poetry to music it becomes rap So it s Yeah it s all together More relaxing Oh Yeah Really Oh man Oh man when working out I like I go for like female pop artists and or um lately I ve really been liking to listen to songs that have um the beat that s like slow quick quick slow quick quick cause I when as I took a dance class a few like last week of the s style that like has a beat that way and I really liked it so I just keep listening to that lately Really See I don t wanna If I m multi tasking with my brain and my body I feel like I m not as fully in my workout as I

laughs Mm hmm affirmative They handle so much Yeah I can t possibly think of another answer other than that laughs I guess I really uh just thinking of the computer and you know you know I just think Mm hmm affirmative No I think it s cable based Yeah Under yeah like they re Well they re underwater at least at least I think there s like many layers to protect them but I don t know I just assumed they were always touching the floor and maybe that s part of the problem of where do you put the cables because they re in areas are deeper than others You have to maybe find a path Because a whole other problem cause if inaudible introduce me you try to curve Ohh yup When they re sheared Yeah but it s probably why they re probably why they re encased like It s like it just keeps coming out yeah Magic laughs Mm It kind of moves like uh constantly down there Let s try our best The cards are over there though Yeah Yeah I ll try it I ll try Can move this We ll just play one hand or just play on

136,day_5__con_1,1,2,curtis,male,1744,3490,True,Okay first thing is first is there anything we re wearing in common Oh we re all wearing shorts Yours look like a skirt Skort nice Huh That s awesome Yeah so it s like your fancy like a little bit but like comfy And biking oh true Yeah so it s not like flapping Yeah Actually have you seen in the old days like the female bike seat that s sideways So then you can like sit to the side Yeah it s completely impractical like unfair Um okay uh so yeah so shoes True and we all have shorts and we all I have an undershirt so I guess we all have a T shirt on And the glasses Laughs Laughs I noticed actually I saw when you walked in Laughs I was like what happened there But I didn t want to question it Yeah it s okay Sometimes actually you ever wash your hands and then you lean up against the counter and there s a layer of water that s invisible And you go right up against it to wash your hands and you come back and it s just like so awful and embarrassing and I get Oh around here Okay Yeah for me it s it s right at the place you don t want it to be I know but then for some people it would be like you know they would be like trying to wash their hands Yeah Also true Oh I m digging the not actually being on a script it makes everything so much better so that the conversation is more dynamic and interesting Oh my gosh that s terrible So one time my sister when were why did it get so bright I m just gonna turn this off I feel like it s oddly bright One time my sister um we were on a trip I don t even remember where we were going but she I was just sitting in the car as a kid and I was sitting in the car and uh she had to fill up gas And we stop at the gas station and she gets out and I m not really paying attention at all and then I hear her just yelling Like Ah Like freaking out like just all this noise I have no idea I think I was playing Game Boy or something you know just something kids do And my sister s like Ah I look back and she s spraying the gasoline everywhere Like like AH Like yelling and screaming and there s gasoline like shooting everywhere And she s covered in gasoline like soaked in gasoline it smells horrible you know and it s just shooting everywhere It broke The gasoline nozzle broke yeah And you couldn t turn it off So she wasn t even holding the handle And it sprayed it went it was filling up right And then some like metal latch thing broke and kept it stuck and so she was trying to like pull it out but she couldn t pull it out and then it filled up the car and started shooting out of the car I know and then she was pulling it and like screaming She was really mad Uh I I don t think she paid for the gas no Well we rode like five just like five like maybe like 30 seconds in the car and I could not stand the smell Neither could she Like we could not breathe she reeked Horribly toxic but also like if a match Like any spark you know And she was really scared to get in the car because maybe the static electricity of the doors could create some kind of like Like electrical interference and so we were really really nervous and stuff and uh she had like athletic wear on so I think she she took off her shirt and was in like a sports bra which of course she didn t feel super comfortable doing We were in a like random area and but we ended up stopping at a gas station and like buying like crappy gas station clothes which they gave us uh not sorry I shouldn t say crappy gas station but like you know they were just clothes that you buy that are super cheap Yeah like really cheap like two dollars for a shirt that just advertised something And they gave them to her like even cheaper because they could smell that she was covered in gasoline and we told her what happened and then she just changed in the bathroom And we and we threw away her clothes that she was wearing Yeah but it was terrible It was kinda funny No I haven t Oh yeah That s great have you seen that that has Ben Stiller in it right Have you seen Dodgeball That s one of those movies that I feel like has like a crowd of people who really dig it and then other people are like What is this movie But there s like certain lines from it that are super memorable like he s like If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball Like there s just these things that are so memorable It s awesome Yeah yeah it s good But it s it s pretty new to become like a cult classic It hasn t been around that long Only what like 12 years or something I don t know yeah I thought it was middle school but I I don t know Depends on age and stuff Yeah maybe like maybe like 12 to 15 years ago But there s also a part where he s like trying to get fit so he smells pizza and he s like but he won t eat it you know because he wants to be healthy and he s like and then somebody s walking in the door and he has nowhere to hide the pizza but he doesn t want someone to know what he s up to so he just like stuffs it down his pants It s just it s a funny movie There s another scene where he says uh there s uh oh yeah there s this guy who comes the guy who says If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball His I can t remember his name it s like No it s um it s the it s the this older character Like he plays an old guy uh but he s really not that old He play I think he also plays plays the father in um the movie where the two sons the brothers box each other Maybe it s just called Warrior Yeah he plays the dad in that I think But they they call him patches In the Dodge Ball movie and he um he uh yeah he says something else he says something super funny Oh I shouldn t say that Okay but he says something else He says something else that s super funny he says uh there are five rules of dodge ball it s like duck dip dive something or no no it s dodge duck dip dive and dodge And these are the five rules and he says it like over and over and every time the people are just like like and they re trying to figure out like wait what Why why what is this five rules It s really funny They also have these people who are like the people who go against them and one s name is Laser and one s name is uh like Blazer And the other no crap One s name is Laser the other one is like Taser and the other one is like Toblazer And the other one it s like stupid you know I I ve seen it like probably twice but it s just super memorable Because the way that the jokes they they re kinda like um who s that actor Will Farrell They re kind of Will Farrell style But they re I think more like pointed Just like duck dip dive like the way they say crosstalk Yeah Yeah Oh yeah it s in it s in a song by Jay Z Wait how s it go How s it go It s like uh it s like we gettin lit like gorillas and then and then they re like And he s like what does that even mean And he s like I don t know but it s provocative and then Jay Z sampled that with Kanye West and put it in a song that s called uh like something in Paris and uh yeah it s just really funny It s a hit radio song Super popular song just type in like Jay Z Kanye West in Paris Type that in the internet and you ll see it s a really good song But yeah it totally just stops in the middle of the song and it s like what does that even mean Yeah Yeah Oh he says We re going gorillas He s like We re going gorillas And then like it stops and goes to this film scene where it s like I don t even know what that means Well that s fun wait what what is your alls favorite movie and why Yeah Okay just so it s not don t think of it like a reflection like oh this is the movie that like you associate with just a movie you like Oh I want to say a movie I have one in my mind actually It s pretty good it s one that I feel comfortable saying is like close to my favorite definitely top ten Is the intouchables or in in intouchables 00 10 55 It s french And I m not a huge fan of like foreign films necessarily like I prefer to understand the language but even captioned it is so effective in terms of like giving you an emotional connection with the characters The Untouchables is about that s the really American accent way to pronounce it The Untouchables is about this person who s a paraplegic Or no he s a quadraplegic Have you seen it Okay It s about the relationship of him and the person who takes care of him so he s a guy named Drese 00 11 28 the character is named Drese but it s played by uh oh I can t remember his name right now It starts with an O Anyway he s a really great guy and he has like a wonderfully happy like vibe he gives off that just makes you feel like happy to watch him and like warm But anyway there s this guy he s like very wealthy he s a tetraplegic and he has all these people who take care of him but they don t give like they don t care about him at all and so then he ends up finding this guy Drese and uh who just wants him to sign some papers so he can get a welfare check and but he likes the fact that he s different that like he doesn t look at the tetraplegic guy and like just feel bad for him and like be like oh whatever Because this guy Driss has a lot going on in his life so when he sees when he comes in to get his welfare check the tetraplegic guy who needs someone to take care of him sees this guy Driss and he s just actually like This is the kind of guy I want to take care of me Someone who doesn t feel sorry for me and make me feel sorry about myself all day long Someone who doesn t really give a crap about me but they re strong And this Driss guy is like a pretty big strong guy but they re just strong and like they ll appreciate the fact that I have a nice house cause they re not from this background and they ll be able to like lift me and do all this stuff And so he ends up hiring him even though the guy just wanted to get like a paper signed for welfare and definitely did not want to be there and then it shows you how their relationship evolves and it s super funny too it s like a really comical movie but it also has this wonderful beautiful story of a relationship evolving between like it s it s not like a typical relationship movie right it s not like a lover s relationship And so Yeah to some degree but I think by the end you know you re right you re right Always there s like a one guy is serving another And but it s interesting because the power dynamic is like who has the power Because one of em is a tetraplegic The only power he has is simply to pay the other person for service and yes the other person is serving him but he s the one with like the strength and yet he s the one that comes from the poor background It s a beautiful story It s a real story they just made a movie about it Yeah It s pretty good Anyway that s probably my my go to Wait I m gonna be the worst right now I watched that and I was just like what am I watching Like Laughs Yeah You liked it Thought it was great yeah nice I quit watching it just so you know Yeah cause I was just like seriously what Like we re switching around so much I know these people are probably going to come together at the end but I m like super not I don t care at this point Like I was like 45 minutes in and we re still switching around and I was just like I m sorry but I have a 2018 attention span Because all like Twitter Snap all this stuff is like five second information and now they re making me wait 45 minutes And I know I need to just grow up and wait the 45 minutes but I m annoyed yeah No So here s the bad part of me okay cause I know you re enjoying it so I wanna I wanna like push this a little bit Yeah Laughs watch the language though Um so um yeah what is it about that that is like not obvious Like that makes it interesting to make a whole entire movie about Cause to me it s like yeah of course I ran into one person at one point in my life who said one thing Yeah but there s been a billion movies about this have you seen the Butterfly Effect Yeah Okay So because both of them are underwater it s connected Oh okay Oh I got you I got you on ambition I I got you I I think Predestination is more ambitious Predestination is where well I can spoil it for you It is extremely wonderful Very good movie and ambitious And it doesn t have like nobody watches it and is like crap like this is crap You know what I mean Yeah you don t watch it and you re like Oh okay they drew connections through all the plot lines and like so you know they had something like cool That s how I am right Cause I m like negative about this movie I know a lot of people love it like I know that Um and and they as right they should I mean there were a bunch of big names in that movie so they must have believed in the vision otherwise they wouldn t have signed up for it But yeah Predestination I recommend checking that one out And I can say nothing without spoiling it because it s just that you d understand if you watch it can you mentally like note that in your dead Predestination to watch Okay I won t say anything more it s good It s good It s a different kind of ambition but it s very ambitious But it s a different sort of like it doesn t force the audience people just don t get it or they do but I think you ll get it You re smart people I think you ll get it inaudible that s good how s the book compared to the movie Okay Does cloud atlas go all the way back to like prehistoric Okay Nice And and then it okay 2300 that s pretty hard to guess what things will be like Oh so when you say ambitious you mean they tried to be as realistic as they could in all the time frames as well I dig what you re saying I mean that s pretty cool Nice Yeah That s what you were mentioning Oh cool Okay yeah Okay So you re saying there s a lot happening at different levels okay cause I think it s one of these things where if you describe it cause I didn t finish the movie right I was just like okay I m done Like I got to like literally just like 45 minutes in and then I was just like I m not gonna do this anymore And so it sounds to me like it s one of those things that the people who like it really really like it because they can find more and more that was sort of put into it that s not immediately obvious Yeah so that makes a lot of sense Oh yeah Very little Yeah Okay One one last one that we should probably like cut the conversation for data set wise but one last thing um have you seen Idiocrasy Laughs no but you said you were like a movie person I know Yeah yeah you should tell us yours It s super modern like last year Or in the spring I saw trailers for it I haven t seen the movie Like something from space coming and annihilating Really I always thought cosmic referred to the cosmos Okay I dunno these that s already fancier than my movie horror you just whipped out two I have no idea what they are Lovecraft and Cthulhu Yeah Oh these are people People oh I know M Night Shyamalan Because he puts his name or she is it a he or a she He puts his name like in huge letters like boom M Night Shyamalan and so I know that person Yeah What about Steven King And who sorry who s first Steven King or Lovecraft Old school alright cool That s why I don t know him yeah Oh did he make Alien the movie Oh Oh well why would I know him What we re talking about movies modern movies Oh okay Yeah Oh okay I feel like I well actually wait This concept of just immediately going crazy when you Yeah It s something that s hard for me to believe because I think people who go crazy from exposure it requires like many years like a decade of exposure to something like they re Yeah if you don t understand it how can you like interpret it well enough to go crazy from it cause you just don t understand what you re seeing cause you can t understand it No no no I mean like for the fun of the question not not like a ugh how do you know But like a fun question how can you possibly know enough to go crazy if you can t understand what it is you ve seen But then you d have to spend like a year like there are some physicists who have like tried to study like the depths of quantum before you know we had good theories from Einstein and things like this who went crazy historically Like they just spent so much time like thinking about like the way that the universe where it came from and where it s going and all this that they were just so out of tune with like reality that they kind of lost their mind There s historical cases of this but those people were experts for like decades Spending like all this time studying these things I haven t no What How Oh yeah Let s not talk about VR stuff Okay,True,vid_136__day_5__con_1__person_1,False,False,day_5__con_1,False,False,True

Spilled over my pants this morning Yeah Laughs Yeah Just bad luck Yeah Yeah They should start building bathroom countertops higher so it s more at belly level Right okay yeah yeah Yeah I guess sometimes kids need use the bathroom right Was that oh that was hot though That s That can be dangerous Manage software center Right right What the fuck Oh God Laughs Oh God like the the nozzle broke Yeah Yeah That seems like something like that you could like get really mad at the gas station for like hope hopefully you guys Did you guys have to pay for the gas Okay Yeah Yeah yeah And that s like that s like somewhat toxic even right I think Yeah that s scary too Oh shit yeah yeah yeah Yeah really cheap clothes yeah Yeah that s terrifying Oh yeah yeah crosstalk 00 05 18 But then And then they all die right Yeah Yeah So like long time ago I barely remember it That s inaudible come like a phrase and like like that s like spoken in english in general I feel I hear some variance on that Yeah I was gonna say like that s like elementary school right Something like that Yeah some yeah Yeah Laughs Mm hmm affirmative I don t know that one Laughs Laughs How long ago did you see this This is like a lot of detail you remember Okay Mm hmm affirmative Yeah yeah Yeah Okay sure sure inaudible there s saw some like something with Ben Stiller Blades of Glory and it s like Yeah like really bizarre like motivation and plot but it s like certain phrases have just like stuck Yeah iron lotus there s like that that audio clip that the chunk where it s like uh something something like gorilla it doesn t make any sense but it s provocative There s some there s some quote like that Yeah yeah it got Yeah like it got sampled in some like pop big songs What does that mean What does that mean It just like music just drops out plays that audio and like the music comes back in Yeah that s what We re going gorillas Favorite movie oh Honestly like entirely like turn my perception right now cause I was thinking like really like really like low quality Yeah like like B minus movies now I gotta think about what movies I actually appreciate I don t I don t know Yeah And not not quite like the best of bros cause there s still serving happening to some degree There s like a certain power dynamic but they re still like very close Mm hmm affirmative It sounds very nice Mm hmm affirmative Alright I think I got mine Mine is Cloud Atlas Yeah I was like when I watched it like I like everyone else in the room is like that was amazing that was like one of the best movies I ve ever seen And we like found out it had bad reviews we re all like what the hell Yeah and like yeah I know A lot of like a lot of my friends like basically all my friends I ve shown it to like love the movie I dunno Uh Yeah I thought it was great I mean I It s definitely like kind of like weird you can t really it doesn t give you a chance to get close to any one of the characters too much right You can cheer you know like so you guys have both seen it right Yeah so like you know you can cheer this like you know this guy Okay Laughs So they don t actually tie together that much Laughs so so so so very very tangentially So it s not like you have these you know separate threads and then they all tie together to some like big goal or message No it s more like you have this thread and you find out that like some random thing that happened here is like where another thread would take off But it s like you know extremely minor like the plots the plots are not really connected there will be like single elements Yeah come on come on shit on me Okay okay So so the plot the plots themselves don t really tie together but there s like parallels between the events so like you know you ll have like this story where this person is overcoming this kind of problem and then in this story this other person is overcoming this other kind of problem And some levels it s like very like visually obvious like this person s like boat is sinking and like you know they re trapped inside somewhere and like they re starting to drown underwater And like inaudible the inaudible big action scene it cuts away and you got this other scene where now we see someone else escaping from something also underwater but like in a totally different setting instead of a boat it s like you know a secret underground canal system or something like that And so you know it s this you know kind of cool way of showing oh this scene is connected to that And you something like lots of the actors Well very that s like the very superficial ones right But there s like much much more symbolic or like thematic ties as well like you know This person s overcoming this kind of like general obstacle in life and this person overcoming that one And so like I ve watched it three times now and each time more of the like the cuts between scenes seem relevant than before Like the first time I noticed things like oh okay that s kind of key like this person s under water this person s under water This person s like you know leaving a prison this person s leaving a prison But like more and more of the cuts you realize that they re showing different kinds of parallels less obvious ones Yeah kind of No now I want to see it Laughs That s fine that s fine That s fine Yeah inaudible get together and watch it at some point inaudible 00 19 22 Have you read Cloud Atlas the book I ve just started reading it I m like a third of the way through Not that big No it s like pretty standard level Um it s structured somewhat differently so it s uh so my mom read it so she told me how it s structured so it s like instead of having like all these things kind of starting and constantly switching off you have like like there s these six separate stories you ll have like the first half of the first story like the oldest one and then the first half of the second one the third one and so on and you get to the most future one and then it goes back down like inaudible 00 20 14 Yeah and it s just like so in that sense it s sort of more linear No the oldest it goes is like 1600 s Um I think or so Or no it s it s like Yeah yeah it goes like 2300 in the future Yeah Are you like a inaudible person Are you into like Oh my God Star Trek has all that like Klingon stuff that s so cool Con Ling 00 21 28 like like made up languages for different fictional worlds if you think that was really cool Okay Oh so one thing that s made like a lot made a lot more clear in the book than it was in the movie the it s like they have this sort of like so like in like the most future one this won t really spoil it like there s sort of like a it s gone back to very primitive civilization Some like big technological apocalypse and now people are like living in tribes again And so the english they speak has some like very modern words but like the grammar has like deteriorated a lot Mm hmm affirmative And then in the very oldest one there s this like there s slave trade happening and their language is also like not as correct english And those in the movie it s not as true but in the book those two versions of english they re speaking have a lot in common and that s supposed to show like the cyclical nature of things Like you build up civilization inaudible 00 22 30 Yeah I d say that s true I think 45 45 minutes was probably about the low point in terms of like what you re getting out of that movie I think But like it keeps increasing across like multiple re watches I think Yeah inaudible what s one movie you like to watch It s one movie I m not familiar Okay Okay sure Sure I m not too into horrors I m not sure if I will What does cosmic horror mean Okay okay okay It s more like existential dread then Huh okay Wait what So Love Lovecraft is like Cthulhu is like the like the age of like scary space tentacle monster like Lovecraft was like a he was like a fiction author like early 1900 s Around there And he wrote he like he like set the like defined like Whatever genre that is Like people just call it Lovecraftian Lovecraft is like over a hundred years Yeah Yeah he defined like like a lot of your images A lot of like alien like horror kind of ideas like he like built those ideas No no like Yeah he s like 100 years ago Like literally Because like Lovecrafty is an adjective like like He built like a very complicated like like okay what up Tolkien is to like modern fantasy like defining inaudible notions of whatever goblins or orks or elves are Like that s what Lovecraft is to a lot of like aliens or like like creepy otherworldly Gods yeah That s because you haven t seen anything sufficiently crazy Have you guys read Snow Crash I know it s on oh yeah there it is Snow Crash It s it s like a major like VR Yeah It s the book that coined the word avatar like your avatar in a virtual world,True,vid_137__day_5__con_1__person_2,False,False,day_5__con_1,False,False,True
138,day_5__con_2,1,2,curtis,male,1207,2475,True,Okay cool Um so the first thing I d like to talk about is what clothing we re wearing that we have in common Um so looks like I ve got a button up shirt and you ve got a button up shirt Socks They re Nike Mine are the Pegasus Fly knit is fancy Yeah Um nice Uh can you just talk about something that either I m wearing or she s wearing and describe its color and like material Hey let me give an example okay So she is wearing a skort which is a skirt that is actually functionally shorts but appears to be a skirt And it s color is navy blue with white polka dots It looks to be a sort of uh soft non completely cotton maybe part pol polyester material Laughs So what you got Or or either of you anybody It is salmon This one s covered It s hidden Yeah Yes I m flattered And Oh that s true Exclusively shorts In the summer exclusively pants in the winter Funny how that works out laughs Yeah Um okay So you gonna describe anything else You don t have to It s true We we we are all wearing glasses Okay let s walk around the room a little bit Um so we gotta find some objects that have not been described which is quite challenging Um Got em Oh yeah man We we ve done these like you wouldn t believe Uh what we haven t done actually is this area here The coat rack that s right So um this is called a coat rack Imagine that there s an AI agent you re teaching like what the world is So that s literally what we what we re goin for Just just for this part of the conversation Just for a few minutes For not the whole thing but just this little part right here So you ve got a coat rack And uh this is called a coat rack and I ll ask questions about things okay So what is this called Kind of looks like rain on a window or something Um maybe heather Fleece vest Oh yeah Inside this is actually a really nice vest Wouldn t you like to wear this I m gonna have to like get these out of here I m gonna start wearing them Okay what is to the right of And and sorry what color was the vest Yeah Gray is fair Um uh what is to the right of the vest A scarf True And uh what just fell on the ground All right It s a different gray They re almost green I would call that olive I think those are olive Off olive Yeah they are gray Yeah It is This is closer to dark green But but I agree They re all in this shade I think nobody really knows what color is what at this point Laughs Um okay So this is a scarf and what color is the scarf Oh this is an amazing scarf Plaid It s fancy plaid It s a great scarf Uh so whoever got that knows how to pick a scarf Okay to the right of the scarf I don t know Um I have no Laughs Here s a jacket A solid jacket Yeah I would say that one of the Prominent visual parts of this jacket is that it definitely seems waterproof Which is something And I feel like the way that you can tell that is sometimes because of the level of shimmer that the jacket has but then also definitely when you feel it It does seem down on the inside Yeah Yeah on the inside it s nicely insulated On the outside it s it s very it seems like it s meant to be waterproof This is maybe even like a crosstalk It seems like it could even be like a snowboarding jacket If you wanted it to be yeah Okay so what color is this coat on the outside Green And what color is the coat on the inside Orange Great Good job team Okay is the scarf to the left or the right of the coat That s right Is the scarf to the left or the right of the coat It s to the left from my perspective Okay So to the right of the coat there s another empty hanger and now what is this object to the right of the empty hanger Or a sweatshirt I would call it It s a sweatshirt with a hood Mm hmm affirmative Yup That works I wouldn t call it a jacket but crosstalk I wouldn t call you crazy for calling it a jacket I would be like I think that s a sweatshirt Laughs All right What color So now I don t know how to label this object What color is the hoodie It s a navy blue yeah a very dark blue Everybody knows that s the way to do it Um cool And to the right of the hoodie What s that So this is a hanger What color is the hanger All right Fun Okay so what is the what are the hangers and all these objects that are on the hangers hanging from What is this A Rod is what I was thinking And it s made of what material does it look like It sounds like it s metal And the main way to tell the difference between plastic and metal in my book at least is to tap it with your fingernail and listen to the sound For sure Okay so what is this object on top of this white shelf What color is the purse I don t know I would call it it looks like it s leather or suede The material is Leather or suede This is some sort of worn leather or something Like they ve they ve tarnished it a little bit Um okay Um so that s pretty good Let s finish off with this bottom object What would you call this entire object here A shoe rack Okay I was thinking shoe shelf but that s because I don t know words Um so this is a shoe rack and uh what what do you call this These two things Sandals Okay What about these two objects What do I call just one of them Shoes And two of them A pair of shoes or a pair of sneakers What color is the pair of sneakers Mostly white with some gray And what color is the pair of sandals Black and brown okay Let s finish off with one more pair what do you call these Are these a pair of dress shoes or are they dress shoes And what color are they Black Okay black dress shoes Great What do you mean the handedness The left and the right So Is this a right shoe or a left shoe Is this a right shoe or a left shoe Okay Is this a right shoe or a left shoe Is this a right shoe or a left shoe Cool I feel a little gross touching this much It s like a little bit Okay um last pair of What are these called Would you call them gloves or a pair of gloves Either way right Yeah I just say because you guys decided to call the shoes pairs of shoes These have handedness Is this right hand or left hand Is this right hand or left hand Okay so this would be a left handed glove And this would be a right handed glove What color are the gloves If I show you the gloves this way can you tell me if they re right handedness or left handed That s right So they should go like this Yeah but it s probably too hard for a camera At least in 2018 Good Okay so that s good stuff Um let s walk a little bit more Uh and we ll end in what was it Eight minutes or something Um let s talk about sound because that just came up So the topic is uh sound Okay And the question is why does if you don t know the answer we can change the topic okay So don t feel like you have to embarrass yourself Because this is not what we do This is just chat chatting But if you tap metal it makes a certain sound and if you tap wood it makes a certain sound And if you tap what is this Tapered Ceramic It makes a certain sound And metal Which we re hearing actually two sounds right Both the table and the metal fork Yup So the question is why do certain objects make uh different sounds and and what is the property of the object that makes the sound Assuming you hit them all with the same amount of force Uh different material Similar shape of object So what does it mean what does it mean vibrations of the air I think what we hear we hear up to to 22 Is it 16 16 I think 16 20 hertz Is the lowest we can hear Kids can hear a little bit higher Yeah so you re saying because the sounds can capture a great deal of information Meaning multiple frequencies within a single wave whereas an image requires each of the individual pixels to capture its high dimensionality Yeah it s it could be a question of representation Because I could just say okay take your your wave and then run an FFT and now we have a matrix of information which is like an image Um so that was a really good explanation You know your stuff I actually do know a little bit about this But I m pretending like I don t Because it s better right If somebody were to like be listening to this data set and they re like oh well this guy claims he knows what he s talking about but he really doesn t But yeah I think the idea of sound propagating as high pressure and low pressure You when Like a if you ve ever built a speaker um the it s it s a fun thing to do actually It s not too hard and you can like go online how to build a speaker The main thing about making a good bass and a good speaker is actually getting enough air So there are like little vents If if you build your own speaker you ll actually feel the air coming in and out Because it has to pull in enough air in order to Create that compression And it s got to force that air together at very high frequencies And so that s that s how you get the hearing And then your ear has the the cochlear shape There s like the a built in FFT Where it s it literally has what is it different hairs of different lengths I I think you Yeah but they re everything They re little micro hairs and they they re different links So so they get vibrated at different frequencies So your ear has a built in FFT Like a for to transform in your ear So that s why we re hear different Now the shape why does the why does the Say that you say that we had a fork made of This is a fork by the way For those who don t know AI agents learning Um this is a fork and it s made of metal Um but say that it were made of wood and I tapped both of them on the exact same surface Why does the fork sound the way that it sounds Which I would claim to be higher pitched Maybe Metal fork excuse me Thank you The metal fork I think has a higher pitch Whatever that means Why is that No I know it s okay Yeah I I think but maybe you know better I think And this is something I don t know anything about but I think it s because the metal has a more um The structure of the molecules create a a lattice it s like a grid like three dimensional grid like shape And that lattice is highly structured which means that the object doesn t they don t move as much And so when a force is applied to them and the vibration it is like going through the lattice because it s more structured it doesn t move as much which means it has higher frequency And so that means the air surrounding it that s getting vibrated by the lattice being vibrated is vibrating at a higher frequency and that s why the pitch is higher And I could have made that up That is sort of my made up intuition I have no idea I know it s granular So I know that it s more there s like more structure in one direction than there is in another Oh like tensile strength this way versus Yeah How is it That sounds like metal So yeah it s a question between discrimination and generation Discrimination just meaning classification And you classify the sound I think is a simpler task then can you generate the sound Because then you have to understand Uh if you wanted to generate in the real world how like the properties of the object make that sound But you can also fake it By generating it Actually I don t know Can is there anything today that can generate without learning and listening to previous Like could you create a program that s never you give it no inputs of audio from sound from metal or anything And you can simulate and create the sound of like properties of many objects without learning from data And do they do they take into account the properties of the object Like the properties meaning like the molecular structure That s neat I don t know anything about this It sounds super hard Yup Yeah that s that s pretty that s super doable There s Yeah I won t mention the names of people There s definitely some folks who work on that And they re solid Well that s cool That s a wrap To turn these things off you press the button on the left left side And it s the one farther forward in the middle yeah And just press it with me,True,vid_138__day_5__con_2__person_1,False,False,day_5__con_2,True,False,False
139,day_5__con_2,2,2,pete,male,1207,1237,False,Agreed on the button ups We also have some blue going on But you don t have blue goin on Nice You do have blue socks We both have Nike s Nice we do both have Nike s Uh I forget what these are but they are fly knit and fly knit is a great technology Laughs Sure I like the polka dots and I feel like there s something about blue with white polka dots that s very classic Or maybe it s a little bit off white but somewhat white Sure Mm hmm affirmative Nice That was very descriptive Laughs Um It s a good little liner And I and I hear that Curtis often wears shorts to work You re wearing shorts We are all wearing glasses Laughs How about the um the different spices Um What s Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Mm hmm affirmative There s a name for that pattern I forget the name I feel like I want to say like heather or something It does Maybe think Definitely a vest and a fleece vest And it s probably made out of some synthetic now that I m feeling it Some some type of synthetic material Polyester Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative It s gray Yeah This is a scarf Well this is just an empty hanger And then this is a hanger with a scarf on it Those are kind of green I would also call them olive but they re kind of a gray olive Yeah They re not like a solid olive This is also kind of olivey Mm hmm affirmative Laughs It s wh mostly white but it has these black lines on it I don t know what you would call this pattern Oh is there a pocket in here Wow so this is an amazing type of scarf that has pockets That is really special I would say it s plaid but plaid usually has multiple colors to it I guess But I guess this is also plaid Mm hmm affirmative I don t know what this is yet laughs Let s skip this This is insane That is a very odd thing I don t know Um okay so I would call this a winter coat Waterproof Oh I think it s down on the inside I can feel the feathers No feel the weight It s actually really heavy Oh no I thought it was really heavy Yeah I think it it says three in one system Yeah dark green I think that s fine That s very orange The scarf is to the left from our perspective That s right I would call this I would call this a hoodie A hooded sweatshirt Or maybe a hoodie or a jacket Cotton jacket What if I said a cotton jacket Laughs Yeah it s navy right Yeah there s another little texture to it And it s got these red lines on the sleeve Mm hmm affirmative That s an empty hanger It s white I would call that a rod Hanging rod Why does it make that sound Let s talk about that later Let s table that Because that will be a different kind of conversation That looks like a purse Yeah Agreed Would you call that a beige Something like that It does feel Leather Definitely this is just a solid leather this strap This is a brown leather strap Yeah and this also feels leather Yeah I would also call it a shoe rack I would also call them shoes Or a shoe A pair of shoes Mostly White Agreed I would say they are a pair of shoes and yeah I would say they re dressier shoes Black I think the handedness of shoes is kind of interesting To discuss that you know This shoe fits this foot my left foot and that shoe fits my right foot but not the other way around So That s a right shoe That s a left shoe That s a left shoe That s a right shoe Gloves You could call them a pair of gloves Yup And these also have handedness That s a right hand Left hand Mm hmm affirmative Yup agreed Yeah I d say brown dark brown I I can only tell a little bit but I m not The easiest way to tell is by looking for where the thumb goes But in these ones yeah I would look for the pinky So this looks like left hand and that looks like right But it s definitely hard that way Mm hmm affirmative Definitely Sound is vibrations of the air So it s definitely about how the materials vibrate Uh that would be a lot to go through but basically the gist of it is when your ear your ear is like a drum And when it hears something it s because there s sound waves that are traveling And basically what that means is there s a little bit a period of higher pressure and a period of lower pressure and that happens really fast That happens at Our ears hear in the range of tens of thousands of hertz down to just tens of hertz 22 000 hertz Somewhere in that range But it s in the tens of thousands of hertz and then we can hear all the way down to like very low Yeah But I do think it s amazing that audio is just like one single wave form But it s so rich in information Whereas like when we look at color images it s you know there s like a million pixels And each can have RGB values at such a high dimensional type of input Where a sound is just a single wave form That s right That s right Push it yeah Mm hmm affirmative I haven t I haven t I haven t gone as deep on Hairs in your ears That s pretty cool Mm hmm affirmative You mean the metal fork Sounding higher Yes I think it s a reasonable intuition I would want to double check it but it seems like reasonable intuition The thing that I don t know is I don t know much at all about the molecular structure of wood Definitely yeah Like that seems to go with like you know visually seeing the grains of wood and there s definitely different mechanical properties either in either along the grain or not Yes it s very different I m pretty sure for wood in different directions Which is kind of cool But I do think in general I think that most people have a great sort of appreciation for how different things sound And they don t very rarely are people really thinking about why it happens underneath Although I think it s interesting to talk about I also just think that like in general just a very intuitive you know like This sounds like wood Yeah I have seen research papers where they just have a ton of data which is video data and audio data And then the task is you know either direction You can take video and try and predict the sound Or either way And I think with enough supervised trainings that you could do that reasonably,True,vid_139__day_5__con_2__person_2,False,False,day_5__con_2,True,False,False
140,day_5__con_3,1,3,curtis,male,1221,1935,True,Okay So the first question sorry about that to start with is uh we can talk about things we re wearing laughs So um uh is there anything that we all are wearing that we have in common I can t quite see your feet I am not I m wearing shoes But you all both have sandals Oh very true Yeah I know Man I am losing Oh yeah we all have Buttons This is good This is the first group that all had uh buttons What is the word Koi pond Oh yeah this is good actually I know nothing about What is fiber arts How do you define Yeah Yeah Right And Karen actually has alpacas that she sheers herself And then spins it into yarn Okay the living Animal That s so that s incredible Wow okay Yeah there s something called I m from an area uh that s like more rural and there s uh we have something called the wool festival Uh um well I won t say where I m from but um Yeah I this is more on the East and but yeah the wool festival apparently there are more But there was a sheering session where all the kids could run up and sheer a sheep And then they d use and they d make wool products It s pretty cool actually What will we do Well then a question So do you guys think that there s like those tasks are pretty enjoyable for many people Yeah do you think that the reason why they are meditative and enjoyable is for an evolutionary reason Or do you think it s something else Um just the fact that these are tasks we had t to be able to do tasks like this and sort of enjoy them in order to be able to make things for our kids to survive Like years ago right like centuries ago And What do you think What do you think Yeah Okay Yeah yeah So then I ll make up some things but tell me if this is a sufficient like uh representation of your theory That we have some sort of uh uh let s call it a bowl for lack of a better term but some container of of like we need to use our hands we need to do stuff with our hands And most of the tasks that some of us do depending on our jobs don t use enough of the stuff in that bowl So then when we get to do them it feels really good because uh we don t want that bowl to be really full No no that s super interesting Yeah so like there have been studies on people are you familiar with Soylent Um well if you only I mean I don t know there are a few people but not too many who only exclusively eat Soylent Or consume Soylent Um I ve tried it I quite love it actually I think I love the taste laughs I know I tell people they re like You are crazy Yeah I like chocolate I only get the chocolate flavor Yeah but so the idea of in case there s some inaudible algorithm that s analyzing this dataset Soylent is uh a nutrient what is it That s right Complete food meaning that if you were to consume a Soylent instead of eating a typical meal it would be sufficient for living Wait can I connect it back Otherwise it s not going to make any sense Just real quick I wanna hear about So comas just save that somewhere okay But uh th the idea about Soylent is you don t use your jaw So you re not using your muscles Just like knitting you re not using the hands Yeah because you re just drinking And the muscles Teeth too although it does less grinding because you don t use your jaw your muscles start to deteriorate And your cheek muscles But anyway tell me about this uh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I love I love the chocolate laughs So I think actually that s interesting I won t name like the place but there are some places where people work where you can get food served to you you know lunch dinner and everything And uh if you have guests who come and visit then when they like they tend to get a lot of food And yet if someone who works there they just get the amount the need because it s not as exciting And so I think that s a great example You overeat because also it s your opportunity to get free food but at the same time it s just so exciting Suddenly your plate is so full by the time you re done you re like almost sick laughs Really has nothing to do with needs yeah it s just uh mental Have y all ever made a quilt out of shirts laughs Wow Okay that s good Best day ever Yeah Okay So I wanna do like a more formalized activity Um it s helpful for all sorts of uses for the dataset So um I want to talk about some objects and I ll sort of ask what they are and then you guys will um sort of answer questions Then you can ask me too So you can be like Okay I m sick of this I get the game your turn laughs And I m totally good with that Because I m always the one who asks so I m happy to do the other We ll have to get up and look at some things Okay Okay Um Let s talk about the objects on this shelf because there s a few new ones that I haven t seen before Um so this This What is this called I just call it a tissue box Oh I don t know A Kleenex A Kleenex box Yeah Puffs Oh facial Okay nice And um what color is it So how would you describe the pattern of the tissue box No that s good laughs Um uh what is this And what color is it I know it sounds almost Yeah it s just No it s okay it s okay It s not a trick No it s It s real Okay great Um and uh how would you describe this tissue And so we know it s white is there anything else you would say to describe it Uh what shape is it I think it s a square but I m not sure It might be a rectangle Okay let s do it Let s do it See this is the thing that AI agents can t do So we ll do it for them It is not a square Yeah so Oh the No that s good That s right Um okay so where is the tissue box now On the shelf of what A bookshelf How many bookshelves are there Two bookshelves and what color are they Um feel free to ask me questions Uh trying to avoid too much brands Oh I don t know But it s hard to tell because of the reflectivity of the surface You don t have to if stuff comes up in your head feel free otherwise I ll keep asking them Yeah I mean so I Wait what question mark What would the liquids be Alright this is uh I ll have to categorize this You re making the post processing of crosstalk No it s okay Here I ll ask one more question And we will get back to that liquid shooting laughs that is a great question But first uh what is this called And what is this called So how do you know that these cards should go into this box Or that the box isn t already full How did it look like it was empty It wobbled a little bit too You heard emptiness That is your super power laughs Yeah and and you can see maybe it s bending more S it s hard it s it neat how we can pick up so much Um okay cool and what color is the actual card So let s move the cards up one shelf What color are the cards White and blue Um and what else Uh we know there are 52 cards but that s cheating There are I checked Yeah okay we can stop this because I want to know about the finger shooting laughs So the question was Um For I m going to get the orientation different for the audio No no it s good it s great I just wanted to mix it up a little Um okay you know the answer Oh wow laughs But wo would it still be expensive once it could shoot out of your finger I never like That person is shooting what you re drinking out of their finger laughs Um laughs Uh okay laughs You re stumping me on this one Um what would I Yeah That s amazing Okay I think liquid gold What is wh the most expensive like like substance that can be

watch You re the odd man out laughs We re all wearing dark colors No wait you re not Oh yeah we do all have buttons laughs I m wearing I m wearing a hand knitted koi pond shawl I don t see either of you wearing that laughs So the pattern is koi pond I knitted this We have a fiber arts group and I posted many many many pictures of it in progress and finished in the group Because you re not a fiber artist Oh yeah sewing counts Yeah Fiber arts encompasses laughs Fiber arts encompasses many areas of expertise Yeah And when it s not so hot that I m knitting the shawl and I m like Oh it s hot So anything you do with like yarn or string or thread or fabric Like anything where fiber has been made into a thing and then you do stuff with it Um so knitting and crochet are kind of the typical ones but also quilting embroidery any kind of sewing A lot of people sew their own clothes Um spinning Karen and I both have spinning wheels laughs which is And then spins yarn And then knits it into yarn It s extreme I think she has like 5 alpacas I don t have alpacas but I do have a spinning wheel but it s large and it takes up more of my house than it probably should Oh yeah down in Oregon or somewhere else Okay there s a big one in Oregon Oh yeah there s yeah There s lots of them Yes laughs Yeah it is and it s one of those eclectic hobbies that s kind of useless and it would have been really useful in the 18 th century but it s kind of useful now or useless now and then but it s still like just satisfying to just do something with your hands laughs laughs Mm hmm affirmative Yeah They re like meditative Yeah Yeah Like I have a theory about it I can tell you my theory So there s concrete things where you do concrete tasks right Like washing dishes or spinning yarn or gardening or whatever and I think because none of us do much concrete stuff any like everything I do all day is abstract I email that s all abstract I talk to people about research that s abstract Right Like all the things I do in my job are super abstract And then I go on the internet and I play video games and that s all abstract And then but then to do something concrete where it s like I m using my hands to make a thing is satisfying I think it s just something that humans are really good at and we just don t get as many opportunities to do anymore Because there s no money in like there s no money in me making things because factories can do it because some abstract thinker developed a factory right It s like laughs Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Okay Mm hmm affirmative Yeah yeah Mm hmm affirmative I think that s part of it I also think I went there are a lot of brain structures around specifically movement and again a lot of these abstract tasks don t involve like moving your body And I went to a talk by a neuroscientist where he said that there s really like the whole point of your brain is just to move your body around the right ways And so if we re not using that part maybe yeah maybe there s some kind of like Oh I m not satisfied laughs Like there s some part of my brain that s not doing this thing that it s supposed to Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah yeah Love is a strong word I tolerate the taste laughs Yeah yeah yeah Oh okay interesting It s supposed to be a nutritionally complete food The problem though is there s all these weird micronutrients S so early on when they were developing you know like food for people in comas right So people someone s in a coma they can t eat so they have to get something pumped into their veins or whatever Oh yeah sorry go ahead laughs Yeah yeah Soylent being bland Okay Oh Interesting So it doesn t really feel like eating Yeah Yeah And chewing makes you salivate Yeah that s interesting Wow That s a problem laughs Oh yeah So they were develop I was just reading about this like literally yesterday where they were uh they were developing these foods to keep people alive and they and everyone started getting this weird form of diabetes who was on these things and they weren t including chromium because they didn t realize it was a nutrient people needed But it is and it s something that you get in food And so then they included chromium and and still though people who are on these nutritionally complete developed foods are usually not as healthy Like there s certain things you re missing but it s really hard to nail down what those are because who knows it could be some random little thing Or like Soylent doesn t have cholesterol in it It s like do we need cholesterol who knows You know we get it when we eat normally So no one really knows if we need it or not You probably need a bunch of stuff yeah I don t know it s like it s a weird what does the human body really need to be happy Or like what does a person need to be ha You know does everyone need to knit five minutes a day to be Mm hmm affirmative Yeah There s something about variety That s the other thing too though is is like weight management right So if you re eating very bland food you will naturally ma eat the right amount If you re eating interesting food you ll eat more if it because it s interesting It s like Oh I want some of that you know which laughs is a problem But uh uh but like if Soylent being kind of bland I mean you get the chocolate flavor so it s not as bad but Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Right right Yeah yeah Yeah it s just novelty Yeah and people really like novelty I think that might be another thing about fiber arts there s novelty in doing that you re still kind of doing the same algorithm over and over and over which is kind of satisfying and comforting Yeah I don t know Mm hmm affirmative That s cool Yeah then you re like executing an algorithm Oh you get a lot of free t shirts Yeah Yeah That s amazing Okay back when my husband and I worked in games his goal at E 3 whenever we went to E 3 was like get as many t shirts as possible And I think like one year he got like 22 because

back down it didn t go plonk it just kind of like tapped Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative No but with the way your fingers interact with the cardboard is gonna make a difference noise if there s cards in there Yeah yeah Yeah Well we don t know that Oh okay alright then Plus jokers plus the how to play power card or whatever Mm hmm affirmative If you could shoot liquid out of both of your pointer fingers when you point them what liquids would you choose laughs Okay Okay Sure sure There are drugs that cost like 20 000 for half an ounce probably one of those laughs Lie prescription

would just eat it Yeah yeah well that would be more accessible I was listening to a thing about like raccoons in Costa Rica or somewhere getting into watermelons and they just like scoop out a whole in the watermelon in the field and they just like eat it Like just scoop it out and then you just have this hollow watermelon that goes bad Well they have to like reach way in but like if you had a

time but if you re sort of outside and you see the seasons and like oh it was raining yesterday and sunny today Yeah it just you just kind of feel more like you re in the world Yeah yeah yeah Or even

146,day_5__con_5,1,3,curtis,male,1687,2910,True,And it s t shirt and it s cotton It does have a pocket Okay so you re wearing You re wearing I think jeggings Stretchy jean leggings But they re jeans supposed to resemble jeans And uh they don t look like the normal jeggings I think they re jeggings All right that s it is that Yeah okay Yeah it feels pretty thick it feels like legit jeans Okay then I ll just call them skinny jeans that stretch and um they re navy blue And I don t know They look like normal pants Um okay so that was fun So let s pick something an object and describe it so what is this called This is a pillow or this is a pillow This is a pillow And this is A blanket Uh what color are they the same color Which one is darker The pillow Which one is shinier Pillow If you were to classify them as one color what color would the pillow and the blanket be Teal sea form green Um okay so let s hide the pillow Uh so now just the blanket How would you describe the shape of the blanket And what about the texture Knobbly yeah Um what about what do you think it feels like He wants it laughs I warmed it up I actually warmed it up in here That was good okay So um so that s an object Let s pick one more object in the room Um can you tell me what this uh large thing is that says that has like a map of the world So it s a T V and what color is the T V What are these two panels what s this on the right side And this on the left Yeah is that which Is this the left or the right That s the left And um what s being displayed on the T V No you shouldn t Um Just but but generally it s the map of The world Earth And yeah there s uh lights and we ll see that those somehow have to do with connections and that s relevant for people Um if you stare at it long enough you can tell certain things but we don t need to talk about that Um so another question below the T V what is the circular object Yeah or camera And what color is the camera I think it s black on the inside and silver on the outside Wait what did you say white Maybe I think it s silver actually Yeah if you look at this table versus this camera it s definitely more gray Yeah we won t Yeah these are definitely off white Um but this is lighter white right And then that would you call that at what point does off white become gray Maybe I think it s reasonable Um okay so my final question is what is this object right here I ll call it a remote control Because I know it has to be one word for the like models so say this is a remote control And what color is it laughs Okay let s call them white yeah that s fine And uh there s two red buttons Um and anything else How would you describe the general shape of the remote Uh I was going to say tetrahedral But I m not 100 sure that s right I think that is that wrong Tetrahedral is actually a triangle in 3 D Prism prism yeah Yeah tetrahedral is like a A carbon structure right like a CH 4 where you have three on the base and one on the top and it forms A 3 4 triangles So um typically but not necessarily equilateral Um okay so that was fun and I actually think we legit covered the entire room I don t think there s too much left there s one more thing No or we an if you want to Okay uh what is this called So give me three words to describe this object Or like I would say wire cord And cable Sorry that was hard Okay those two were Yeah everybody pick one what do you want to call it of those three words which is more accurate Cable Okay so uh what color is the cable And um about how what what shape is the cable Yeah I m trying I think it s cylindrical but I m not sure it s a good description for the shape Okay Yeah that s good Um I m trying to imagine if you were an Asian and someone was describing a wire to you what words would you need to be able to classify a wire differently Long and skinny I m not sure What is it that is sufficient to describe a wire Or a cable or that particular object It could be inflexible who knows Just by looking at it without interaction Yeah it has a helical shape You got any other ideas laughs Okay enough with the wires We re done with the wire So um question have you guys talked what likes have we not discussed Um you haven t But Yeah he s done any Uh you ve done drinks Uh season You ve done food sport Uh you haven t done sports Okay so there s three questions What is your favorite sport to watch what is your favorite sport to play and what is your favorite outdoor activity sport like or not Yeah Um Yeah yeah And why for those And if this sparks anything in your head are you thinking of what yours are or anything Okay Or like for each one why do you pick that one To watch it Yeah So the reason why is because other people who are in your life are also interested in it so it s a common thing to talk about Yeah laughs I don t know how to describe it You re like not zero excitement about soccer laughs You re like I love it it s my favorite laughs Yeah This is your favorite to play Yeah that s good And then what about the favorite one in nature Yeah Yeah that s good Okay what about you Nice I think my favorite to play is basketball just because I grew up playing it and so I really do it well and it like gives me memories and makes me feel good and then um what is it to watch is I don t like to watch sport Uh and to outdoors I like hiking I like mountaineering I like the challenge of conquering a mountain I think mountains reflect life actually I m interested if at any point you re like having thoughts please be natural with your conversation it s not like an interview Well like Yeah it s good It s post lunch but unfortunately it s a talking data set I wish it was listening though me too But yeah so I want to hear your thoughts on this so I think that mountaineering is actually this is very ridiculous so inaudible but see what you think not that ridiculous but I think it reflects life I think it s very symbolic of challenges in life If you have you ever climbed a really intense mountain Oh but you ve done one Have you what s like a biggest mountain you ve climbed Nice Okay so Enchantments are in the Pacific Northwest and there s a bunch of mountains And then Cloud Rest was Enchantments Yeah uh Clouds Rest is in Yosemite Was The Enchantments which what did you core Enchantments Like south of Leavenworth Yeah Yeah and it is nice Yeah I thought it was really nice actually The Clouds Rest is also that s a good one Um if you ever climb something that s three times the height of Clouds Rest something like that You feel your body literally giving up like you have a headache you re in pain you have horrible de oxygenation in your bloodstream Your entire body is miserable complete fatigue exhaustion Every step is like three times the energy just to take a step is exhausting Your body feels heavy uh yeah I mentioned the headache but the headache is like super intense This is when you are pushing over 14 K I mean it s different for different people The apparently there s no effect on the body above like around 8 000 for most people but above 8 000 people start to feel it And when you get above like 14 000 or maybe even 13 000 you really feel it And so that s why people talk it s not it s not I don t know if this is the cause but people often refer to the 14 000 footers As being challenging meaning that if you climb a mountain above 14 000 feet it s a challenging hike Well it s also physically exhausting to get yourself up that high It s lik a lot of vertical climb but yeah de oxygenation of blood is just it s really it s called what is it called apox hypoxi Yeah it s a awful feeling but yeah I relate it a lot to challenges in life because when you re trying to do something that s really difficult like really difficult like think of some of the most challenging things that you ve ever done and you feel like it s like you just can t go on but you could just take another step right You can always take another step you can always do just like just a little bit more Like eventually you do get to the top of mountain and you do beat the obstacle and whenever I think about climbing mountains I think about this and it makes me feel motivated Yeah totally I mean you measure It s like quantify Yeah Yeah totally It s good You have any thoughts Okay different topic So this is a question of imagination We did this before Okay we ve done The Lady on the Bench right So I have a new one Oh and we did The Dentist okay Um so I ll just say a few words and then I ll ask you some questions Okay and it s intriguing because our minds are full of priors over imagination and we ll see how they evoke so um here s the scenario You you just are starting a new job and you re meeting uh you re meeting your boss for the first time try to imagine it like it s a new job one you ve never done before and you ve just met your boss I think just walked in and like you re about to shake their hand can you see it What does what does your boss look like Nice and is there anything in the room Is it is there There s a security desk At this place that you re At this fictitious place has a is it based on anything in real life Oh okay Yeah sure and is was everything else about the environment the same as in real life Yeah Yeah Okay that s cool what about you laughs Gotta be skinny That s funny laughs Nice That s it Is there you re in his office though You re still in his office what s in his office And the walls are completely white Nothing on any wall The clock and paintings what kind of clock analog or digital Analog Nice And what s the clock look like laughs It s 11 00 that s fantastic your mind is like that s my prior That s 11 00 that s what it is Nice Yeah that s much more detail I just imagined for some reason I imagined mine was a he and I went and I went to shake he s bald he s um well I guess I won t say any names but he looks like a famous CEO who s pretty wealthy and is bald and uh and for some reason there was a table in our way and when we go to shake our hands I hit my shin And that s what that s what popped in my head I don t know why I don t know if it s cuz of this thing is here But I imagined just like straight shinning myself into this table What I don t know my shins are very sharp I don t have too much covering them so they but no that s that s never happened to me I don t know why I imagined that it s just what popped in my head Um and I have no idea where we are The carpet is just like the blue fake carpet That has like I ll call it for better sake for sake of a better word like vomit protection by having Like speckled Yeah that that coloring um yeah so that s what I imagined Oh and he s like coming down like Hello have you been waiting Have you been waiting for her For her Nice okay We ll do one more imagination So that s the imagination thing I think it s neat Cuz it s like oh that s what the prior is over in my brain Um so uh the idea is try to come up with things that aren t you you won t immediately think of things you ve already done So um have we done the dog Okay imagine that you uh Oh we did do it Oh right right okay Um all right so a different one It s uh it s your wedding okay And um you re getting married and uh I know you I know you re married try not to Try try I know I know just okay never mind we ll pick a different Um yeah Okay uh pick something else So here s an example um you re going to your work is having a trip And they re taking you to a horse park All right and uh you just got to the horse park okay you stepped out of the car Uh whatever just Just the word is horse park that s all you get You and you stepped out of the car there s two vans they dropped everyone off The vans drop everyone off and now the question is uh what are you standing on right now What do you see in front of you What does the horse park look like And uh like what are the people around you like laughs Could you imagine riding the horses Okay But you are imagining people are going to ride the horses Okay That doesn t happen at horse parks usually but that s okay I know I know It s okay Yeah No that s good that s okay So yours is a riding horse park Nice And what s the what s it look like Yeah Is there any water Nice Is that based on anything that you ve been seen in real life Yeah and what were the people like who were with you You already mentioned that one was wearing shorts Are most of them older or younger Do you think that s based on uh where you tend to work in real life And do you think that the general faces were just a compilation of people you ve worked with in real life Yeah okay No that s totally reasonable Yeah out of context it sounds weird but Imagination wise mine don t have particular faces I see bits and pieces of like gray hair so that means they re older and yeah for some reason I imagine them mostly as like 35 year old women and I don t really know why that s just the people who I was working with In my imagination yeah I don t know yeah same here For some reason I imagine it to be mostly like 35 year old women maybe 40 year old women um everybody s excited and looking forward to it What do you think what was your Oh also mine is blacktop I was on blacktop not hard packed dirt Oh yeah I was like Yeah Uh so what is the actual ranch look like Or like it s not even she said ranch

don t always know if you re going to succeed if you do the next thing but if you can run that little bit faster that s like a concrete thing you ve accomplished Yeah And you can quantify how hard it was in your head as well Well not quantify but I guess you can compare it like Is it really that much harder to keep studying than it was to do that Like Um she s brunette she has hair about yay long

a person Oh so even if they re a lie he still formed the human connection so the so it s good And you like the movie because of the psychological aspect of what is a lie or not or because of Like the general theme of Yeah Yeah no it s good So the the someone previously said that they love their favorite movie is Cloud Atlas I didn t like the I only watched the first 45 minutes I didn t like it but

guys haven t heard it But I really love the movie Intouchables It s called The Intouchables Oh did I tell you this Okay Okay yeah it s I ll just mention it briefly It s about someone who s very wealthy who s a tetraplegic and No arms or legs Um entire actually fully paralyzed up to the head And uh it s a real story Para Um I may be using the wrong word It may be quadriplegic But I think the word is tetra but I may be wrong Anyway he s fully paralyzed up to the neck and he uh it s about his sort of bonding relationship with someone who uh does not did not intend to work for him Just needed to get a piece of paper signed so uh by like a rich employer um so that he could say that he tried to get a job But he knew that because this person was like uppity and high class they would never like want him And he wasn t qualified at all So he so he does it intentionally to get the government to like uh just give him welfare But then the guy actually hires him Because he s sick of like people who are basically see him and pity him And everyone who ever sees him pities him But this guy just shows up and he s like Oh dude you can t move That sucks And and he like really digs that because he s like This person treats me like a person Not like an object that I they they need to pity And he really liked that so he ends up hiring him and it shows how the relationship grows this like untrained guy who s like had a really bad life and this like very wealthy person who s also had a bad life And it s interesting because one of them is the boss of the other right He s employing him But the person he s employing has all the strength and skills of of like regular human beings And and he doesn t It s an interesting power dynamic and a relationship that turns into a beautiful and very comical wonderful friendship And it creates a a a beautiful story It s in it s a good one You don t have to like compete We re not competing I just Yeah What do you think Just pick one Have you seen Predestination That s a weird one It s pretty good You could also do favorite book Yeah I m not well read I m uh I m well read in historical stuff not not modern crosstalk Kind of sounds like

was just like oh okay like clearly like I don t know anything about any modern movies because I don t know this guy from like the 1700 s No no I m kidding I m kidding yeah but they were whipping out words Um yeah if someone actually listens data set through then they ll actually be able to check what I m saying and then I ll probably sound kind of dumb because Uh like I actually have no idea And it was it was two famous people who like defined horror films uh before film even existed But I don t remember what their names were Yeah I remember one was Love love something Lovecraft But there was someone else even before them that started with an M that was some word like Mathilda or Maton I can t I don t remember the name The Time Machine is by Lovecraft Okay I ve read that too Wait what was

The point is very simple It s this guy discovers a pearl He s like a fisher A fisherman but he s I I think he s poor I can t quite remember I I m I m very young when I read this But he finds this pearl and it s like the biggest pearl ever okay It s just so big and he he s like Oh I ve got to get out of town before people find out about this pearl and kill me and and you know and profit from it That s the that s just the the storyline So he gets this pearl and I think he has his family with him And they go on a big hike And they re trying to escape and I thought you wanted to sit down Um so they and they go on a big hike and then there are people who are hunting them and they chase them down they chase them down and I can t quite remember how it ends but I think it ends very badly and it shows that basically uh money is bad That s pretty much like sort of the theme of the book that or like Or yeah sorry I shouldn t say money is bad I think the actual So I I really was just a kid when I read it but I think that what I got from it at the time was that something that was that should be ha good luck was is the worst luck ever That s basically like the moral is like he lucked upon the best thing ever right Like the best pearl ever and that resulted in his death Like all it brought was trouble and bad luck every day since he got it Even I was little Like I was like seven or eight or something But I I remember reading it and thinking like This is this is a good idea Like write a book about so like because you it s be careful what you wish for right It s the common classical But the story s done really well and it s well written Uh I find Steinbeck like a comfortable read Um so I thought it was nice Funny books What s an example of a funny book that I might know Have you read Cat s Cradle Oh that s got boko maru in it You should look up boko maru after this conversation It s an interesting I don t want to get into it Well I ll I ll describe it but I won t describe what it

that comp in its entirety Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Wait is it a is it about that guy who has his dad who like tells tall tales and like Oh yeah yeah okay I remember this movie now Yeah Yeah yeah Mm hmm affirmative Could be Could be Yeah I can t remember the movie completely but it sounds like one of those themes of does it really matter if you know if the stories are true or not because through hearing them and experiencing him telling them you understand him as a person Yeah I don t know Yeah if you re The dad All the stories Yeah Mm hmm affirmative That s why I would like the movie I don t know why you do Yeah I haven t seen that or read it Oh Really Wait wait why is that a mistake Really Why What Oh For me like if I watch a movie on a plane I m like wow this is the only thing I can be doing right now And then I actually focus yeah Yeah Yeah You drift in and out I guess it depends on how long the flight is and like where you are in your kind of natural circadian rhythm Yeah Yes I haven t I don t think I ve heard of Oh Yeah Dang That s So that s why it s tetra and not quadri because it it Okay Huh Is it quadriplegic Huh Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative laughs Oops Mm hmm affirmative Yeah laughs Yeah Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah It s an interesting power dynamic Yeah Aww I want to watch that now Yeah Oh no no this is just like a nice like a nice forest of movie recommendations is forming Um I m trying to think of No I haven t I m trying to think of Hmmm Hmmm I really like action films because they re typically very simple and I can just kind of check out and watch explosions happen laughs Um but uh Yeah Oh favorite book Okay favorite book in that case I know exactly which two are my favorites Um House of Leaves if you ve I don t know if you ve heard of it Um okay I m like I m like all about the scary scary spooky fiction business so um I really like House of Leaves and it s by what was it Mark C Danielewski I think and it basically is like three stories layered together like there s a story happening in the footnotes and then the majority of the book is a manuscript of a dead man that the guy that s like writing in the footnotes found and is trying to put back together And then inside that manuscript this guy is like trying to uncover the story of these series of tapes that this fictional um photojour like prizewinning pho photojournalist put together And the and the tapes it s crazy Oh yeah it reminds you of Memento Yeah no no it s completely different though Um Okay cool Basically like That s true I know But I mean I m I m tired too I went to the gym yesterday Anyway um so then the tapes that the guy is the Okay so the guy I think who wrote the manuscript is named Zapato but the the tapes he s looking into like basically it is like a five minute YouTube video type thing where this guy s filming this door in his house and then he goes to the outside wall and there s no opening but when he comes back inside and looks in the door he can walk into it And it s about this house where the inside dimensions are a quarter of an inch bigger than the outside and his family lives there and every time they leave and come back a new doorway appears a new room appears until eventually that door that leads to something but is supposed to face outside appears and um It would make a really good movie except for the part where it s like triple layered laughs and there s three stories happening at once Yeah Yeah yeah so it s like so that s that s one of my favorites and what s really cool about it is um if you ever get the chance to like look up or just find a copy the insides are printed in in like a really experimental way so there s like pages where it s more like um what s it called I think it s called like concrete poetry where the form of the words on the page starts to change uh depending on how the words are Like um that s not a very good way of describing it but like there are certain passages where you just have words like spiraling down a page or like falling apart or you have like the footnotes start having their own little box and bubbles and then like things become color coded and it s it s a really it s a huge trip to read and like it s I think sometimes often marketed as a scary story or a horror kind of thing but I came out of it feeling like it was a love story which is like what A lot of people that read it are like kind of in this Venn diagram of horror love story both camps and I m a little more like the both but mostly love story camp It s very good It s very good Yeah so that s that s one And the other one is S by Doug Dorst and JJ Abrams which is a whole other like love letter to the form of Yeah JJ Abrams cowrote a book with a guy and um Yeah so um it s really good Lost I think Fringe TV shows Did he do Fringe No no that was Joss Whedon Oh yeah yeah he did Star Trek Mm hmm affirmative He did Lost I think he did Fringe I m pretty sure he I should know because that s like my favorite TV show of all time laughs I thank you I appreciate that perspective so much laughs Wait What No that s ugh Everyone has their specialties right Aww Wait Wait wait wait Oh darn it What Lovecraft Mm hmm affirmative H P Lovecraft Oh Yeah Yeah like I haven t I haven t read much Lovecraft so H P Lovecraft I don t remember either I don t think s well hmm Because like what a last name laughs Um That s true Thanks Ada I think I I feel like the further back you go like for when a book was published the like kind of slower and smaller that buildup in pace is Like maybe just with modern storytelling we re used to bigger payoff or like a more dramatic and maybe like slow slow slow sudden fast pace of action But I feel like the long the further back you go the more it s just kind of this lofty like there you go Here s the story Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative Okay yeah I was going to s okay I was going to say that I remember that being fast laughs You said 20 000 Leagues Under the Fish laughs I like that Hot air balloon kind of thing Yeah Mm hmm affirmative I read that one uh when I was a little kid

be a noun It could be proper proper noun Those are a bit harder though because sometimes maybe you ll do a reference No proper nouns just nouns Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah sure And he ll write yours

earth it s attached to the earth and it s It s It was never alive and it s natural No That wasn t my question You just literally just told me that I m thinking correctly That my mind works well Um uh is it is it uh is it composed of water Okay Where in outer space Where I mean space is void Well there s like rays there s like uh cosmic rays You guys know the sun gives off um wind Wind Yeah Solar wind Which is composed of like photonic What is it It s just hydrogen gas But there is wind in space Yeah And you can could can you actually pick that up with a sail Is it possible I don t know Is it going in all directions away from the sun Like or is there some gaps I heard the earth is getting hit by like a million mile per hour solar wind right now Like all the time Isn t it crazy We just have a We are amazing Okay all right but yeah So your question is that The answer is yes You can find it in space In fact I ll even help you out It s You can find it like most places Um yeah Yeah You interact with it Is mine a lake So that s that was my question But it Are you going to keep making me guess words that are the same as lake like a pond Okay sure it s a river But keep going Keep going Yes definitely Is mine a waterfall Laughs I like waterfalls They re great Um we re going to help you out I m worried you re going to struggle It is in gas It s in the anything that is gas It s just in a gas If you have gas that s in it Of any kind Okay Keep going That was worth like ten clues I think I just gave you ten clues worth Can I see yours again Oh yeah right Actually thought this would be super chill No it s not soft Is mine a waterfall Okay So I was I wanted to feel good again Laughs I wanted to feel like a winner What does that mean Yes Yes But that s the question that no one would ever ask Such a weird question It s not living You find it in the living room in some places Yeah Yeah It s in mine I mean I wouldn t say that you would expect to find it in a living room Yeah you wouldn t look for it in a living room but you No You It s it wasn t in there when you were there Well actually it it was at one point actually You re not going to be able to come up with it that way Yeah Yeah I d ask questions about the item Not about the location of the item It s not soft we said it s not soft It s not a tool Yeah you It does hold things The fact that you re even acting this way makes me feel like you re getting closer Mm hmm affirmative Mm hmm affirmative That s right That s all good Correct Ah there you go It s There s You re I think you re close enough Wait no she s crosstalk You should get it The word box is on your forehead No No No A blanket box We already told you that you wouldn t expect to find it in a living room but it but it is in Yes Do we have it in here Don t see it I don t see it in here Give you that one Just going to help her out I m going to give you okay I m just going to give you the answer No I m not going to give the answer but I ll I ll change one one word Change the word kitchen to pantry And that that ll get you there It s close It s closer It s closer than you ve ever been before Yeah there you go Yeah I did I did walk through the living room with cereal Yep I had a bunch of cereal boxes like multiple The time Well the time the time is just sub 20 I mean I m enjoying this I could totally play like Is there a way to play a quicker round Is it possible It is about 20 minutes yeah Hm Can we think of a different game Unless you re Hollywood fluent Can we think of a different game that s like super quick We could play I spy okay Do what Oh no it s like become part of me now Okay Um hm So we can I don t think we should be able to pick just any object in the room I think it should be something that s within our near vicinity I know the room extremely well yeah I mean I can do it but I think you guys are really going to struggle and it s not actually going to complete Oh no Um if they come in the room we have to

158,day_6__con_1,1,3,curtis,male,1416,2437,True,I think that s good Yeah I think you look good We can just leave that in the data set so I Let s uh let s immediately like walk over here And I wanna talk about some objects that I I I m basically gonna try to cover every object that I haven t covered already So what is this called A railing Handrail railing What color is the handrail S I I would go with silver Silver Um and what is this called Oh Actually I think banister is is a good word I I als I think it s a railing But it also functions as a banister Right The banister the goal is to make you not fall off the stairs right Oh Okay Okay Yeah I think I think banister s the right word and I think it means you don t fall off the stairs So it holds you in there But the railing is kind of doing that for you already So yeah I think you re right Okay what is and what color is the banister Yeah Um and what what is the uh railing made out of I know but for the sake of a AI agent trying to an answer these what like Yeah okay So the railing is made of steel And what is the uh banister made out of Nice Nice Uh and what is this object right here Yeah I m good with either I was thinking wire until you said cable and then I was like Cable is much better than wire Yeah well you know what So I wanna know which device is the one that So for example a USB cord right You would call that one of three things A cord a cable or a wire And some people I asked people in the other group I was like Which which do you prefer And they were like Cable Definitely cable But then when I see this I think this the right word for this is cable But this is not passing communication this is clearly a very different device So it makes me wonder what is the right word I actually don t know I would call this like a support But that s its function If you were to As I wanna describe the object I d probably call it a metal wire I m not sure Oh like the truth Yeah well yeah Okay Um it s actually kind of making me trip to be like close to them Isn t that trippy And the walls I dunno yeah It s really making it trippy Okay um alright So let s do another And wh what color uh is the cable or wire Silver Is the uh cable reflective or not It is reflective Okay And uh It appears to be comprised of many small Texture And appearance yeah Um nice Okay what is this called right there A nut Now we re getting kind of specific I know English is not like laughing necessarily your native language laughing Um yeah So that s a nut And what color is the nut Yeah Yeah they are Um I know it s I know it s not super interesting Uh Yeah I would call it brown I would say the texture I d say the the pattern is wood and the color is brown And the material Yeah I think that there s wood in there and then that wood has been covered with something like a by laminate Oh yeah laughs Well that s the goal laughs Um okay Yeah Um okay So what is this called And what color is the what color is the wall It s white I have no idea I don t really know what else to say about it so I m gonna move on Oh like all zero And I think this Yeah Yeah so that s really confusing for a data set actually What is this thing It s a shadow I know But that s tricky I think that for a data set to be like shadow I dunno I dunno I dunno if we can do that That s that s very tricky I m sorry for like uh That s okay no it s fine Yeah there s nothing up there that matters Um okay Uh what is this called Yeah I would call it a pole Or a beam I dunno what do you is it I I think of beams running across the ceiling vertically er horizontally Or like diagonally Is a complete vertical support This is a support not a beam right Again I am not laughing Yeah it s I m not 100 percent sure on the uh Okay and what color is let s call it a support Okay The it s black I think Yeah Um it s kind of shiny yeah The paint appears to be kind of metallic Um okay What else has has not been covered So what it this object Handrail Um Color What s the color And what are these objects right here There s three of them Screws Those are square Square head is unusual Oh you thought it was just really broken up like Grinded out Ruined laughs Nice Okay and what is this called It s a mirror And what color is the mirror Come up come up with me Yeah Someone said silver earlier and that it turned into like a 10 minute discussion Yeah the mirror has no color I think is the right answer But but if you want to argue that it s silver then like some people might agree with you No actually Yeah I think I think what you re seeing when you say that the color is similar I think what you re seeing actually is the reflectivity is similar And that s making you think the color is similar So both of them glimmer light like this is reflecting and this is reflecting but I think you re seeing two reflecting objects and thinking as associating reflectivity with color Um possibly but but that s Yeah no no no I know I know I know I know But by definition a a mirror the whole The definition of a mirror is it does not diffuse light Is it dir It gives direct reflection Super scattered just like Well the mirror does have like a little bit little thing here But I I mean Are you saying the edge of it is It s not silver If you look at it from the bottom and look through you ll see that the there s an opaque bottom to it It s like green or something It s like I actually think you re seeing the reflectivity and your brain s getting tricked I I think you see this reflects and you see this reflects and you think same color But I don t think this is actually silver I in any way at all Yeah and it And the particles that compose a mirror I think are like silver nitrate But it s it s the reflectivity I think we see not the color I dunno I won t push too much cause I m not 100 percent sure but Yeah I ve also had a I ve already done this discussion so I have like a bit of an advantage um but yeah Yeah Anyway okay Uh let s do some other a few more objects What has what has not been done We really covered this place um We ve done the pillows we ve done the desk What has It s attribution Like the if you have like a data base right You have has a relationship and is a relationship And has a is attribution and is a is property Yeah That s reasonable I mean that s just def That s just a definition Yeah I dig it I so I I dig what you re saying but at the same time it literally is the definition Like if if if the lamp is blue or the lamp has the color blue then we re just saying Yeah It means that it reflects blue Yeah Oh the language of saying has a color Yeah I think we re I Yeah So I but we say an electron has the what we have defined as negative side Like You know what I mean Like it s gonna have one or the other The convention that s what I was crosstalk Yeah Yeah it s reasonable Okay Um is there an object you think Oh I ve got one I ve got one A new object Ha ha Thank you for introducing new objects into the room Um so Yeah no this is good That s true Okay wait but this one So It is a fire alarm And uh what what is this part of the fire alarm right here So it s a light Yeah And what what do these lines make you think uh this thing can do So when you see these these lines right here what does what does it make you think that this object is able to do Totally not what I was looking for I was guessing it was a speaker but you actually I have no idea No I don t know I wonder if one of these is the speaker and the other one is the detector I dunno either Okay And what color are these letters And these are letters We all agree Um It says fire And what color is the object ignoring these letters Oh Maybe a light gray Really But but this is white and this is not as white It s like gray Isn t it light gray Go closer Get closer What do you think when you look really closely laughing When I was looking at it right up on there it looks quite gray Yeah so from farther away my eyes have more trouble distinguishing the gray But I think it s gray Yeah The people who made it were just like yeah dude the design like let s just put the word fire on the right side laughs On the left That s the temperature that it s at right now in this room It s a thermometer Thermo thermometer I do I do think it s a thermometer yeah I think it s too hot Uh well I can tell you exactly what temperature it is 73 And I think Yeah I know Yeah but it s not quite exactly on 75 right It s kind of slightly the 75 is It s analog yeah So it s it s okay It s within a degree And that that wall might be a little warmer because maybe what s on the other side like What s on the other side is unknown to this data set so we won t talk about it Um okay What is this object right here I m gonna lift it up So this is a long board A skate board And uh what color is the long board The wheels are red And what What is the um what is this an image of A cougar Yeah it s a cougar I m good with cougar Oh yeah You have the secret knowledge Um Oh yeah nice The paint has gotten chipped off Um very good I don t know too much more about long boards Yeah go for it I would call that dark gray And sparkly Because little bits of light are shining off of it and twinkling in my eyes Grippy No Um okay Good stuff Uh what are Can I touch this stuff So what is this object here A carabiner It s a it s a yellow Uh I think it s yellow Let let me put it next to this I think it s yellow Yeah I think it s yellow Or we can put it next to this Definitely off yellow I would call it reflective yellow These are hard you know Actually getting the right names Humans don t know so why should a computer Um okay What about this object Chalk bag If we reach inside Chalk sack With a chalk ball inside but we can t see it Okay And Or chalk ball Yeah maybe that s what it s called on Amazon if you buy it Okay Um okay so and what color is this Uh yeah And what is this object right here And uh Yeah sure Look I made a mess Um okay You want to ask the questions The whole thing Rock climbing shoes Mm hmm affirmative And they have shoe laces Where are the shoe laces Can you point at them Can you touch them Shoe laces Handedness Was the word you used I think that s good Nah screw it Skip the brand Yeah Um Alright let me check the time Wow we almost described r objects for the entire time What is what is this I think you left this in last time Yeah It is a QR code I m not laughing There s a green leaf Or at least a drawing of what appears to be a leaf Although I feel like computer vision algorithm would struggle to identify that as a leaf Yeah What would you call this On on the coloring of this like on the cup Stain Yeah That was in your mouth that you drooled all over the cup laughing I m just tea I m just teasing you laughing I I don t actually know if this is yours either There have been a lot of people in here this could be anyone s cup Um and what do you call when there s a little bit of liquid that sort of dries onto the bottom So this brown ring on the bottom I would call it a residue but stain works too It is staining the color But it s also you can tell that because it s it s a little thicker on the line that it sort of left something That s the residue part You know what I mean We re getting pretty particular Um okay So uh that s it I think we re good to go so you can press the button on

159,day_6__con_1,2,3,pete,male,1416,1775,False,Okay Sounds good Uh Yeah a handrail Well it s metal so it s got a shiny metallic Uh I guess you d call it gray Silver Something So if it was if it had a slightly different look and it was wood and it was a fancier staircase I would definitely call it a banister Yeah I think so They re both made out of some metal It looks like it s also made out of the same material Also steel maybe I would call it a wire Um it s kind of decorative almost like You d call it a cable Mm hmm affirmative Yeah cable I think somebody who is in architecture something like that would maybe have Yeah yeah laughs Yeah And also uh yeah I d call it silver It is It s definitely reflective And it has a lot of texture to it cause it s not it s got these this little braiding to it where it s many small wires that are all wrapped around each other and so that gives it a very particular uh reflective uh setup Um This is a nut The nut is on a bolt laughs It s also silver It s the same it s basically all these things are the same color to me All the things that we ve talked about here But then this is white and this is wood Wood is not a color but uh laughs I it s a it s a brownish wood It s kind of tan wood And also the material is wood too Actually it might it might be a fake wood though Or it might just be a laminate A very thin laminate It it could be a a very and laminate just means very thin wood Yeah which is put on top Well often it can be Do you do you work on the computer vision stuff Okay Yeah Cause all these like all these like reflective properties and things like that are very important if you re trying to like Yeah This is a wall It s white Well I would say it is white but it is a good example of something that probably the RGB values are not really super white Just because Yeah just because the It s it s a good example cause the lighting is Yeah all 255 for all of them just cause Yeah there s a lot of shadows going on here Yeah But it s definitely white And this is also white but it looks whiter right now That s just a shadow I think I just looked at the ceiling a little Okay I don t know it I I do usually think of beams I usually think of beams as being horizontal I do agree about that Mm hmm affirmative That s another handrail Or railing It s also this silver metallic Those are little screws yeah And this particular pattern is a Phillips Although those are No they re not That s not Phillips Yeah these are square heads Sorry I thought it was just like really um What s it called when you Yeah what s it called when you uh When you grind out the Phillips I can t think of the word right now But I thought it was just uh Th there s a particular word but yeah Those are those that s a very unusual screw head yeah That s a mirror The mirror is whatever color it is reflecting The mirror is just reflecting light and so when I look at it here it s actually the light from over there No the the mirror is just reflecting light from elsewhere I wouldn t say it has I don t think it s accurate to say it has no color I think it is accurate to say that it reflects the color from other places Mmmm I don t know if you can say that Cause if I Y you said it s not yellow but what is it then It s just it s reflecting the light from somewhere else But how would you decide what its intrinsic color property is There s a little bevel Is that what you re talking about It s just reflecting light But but also when we say something has a color that sort that language implies ownership like It like I feel like like like If we say an object Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah sure I just think it s interesting though that when we say something has a color it s actually that like that thing is reflecting that color and absorbing all of the other ones So it s actually kind of more like it has all the colors that we re not saying it has you know what I mean laughs But that s overly complicated Yeah sure I guess what I m saying that we usually talk about something having a color as the things that get reflected rather than absorbed but it s actually kind of more I it it s just it s just one minus Yeah Yeah Yeah So it s kind of more like when we say something has a color it s more kind of We talk about what gets reflected but it s kind of more I dunno from its perspective it s more about what s actually absorbed laughs We all agree on what that means Yeah yeah yeah I m just I m just I m just questioning that Yeah Yeah it s it s similar to like we say an electron is negative but like you know negative and positive could all just be swapped Like we do agree that that is the definition we use I m I m just questioning what the definition should be Sure Yeah yeah yeah I I I agree i it s a convention we can all use and I m just saying we we could talk about a different convention This is a new object I brought this one That s a fire alarm Yeah I think that that just has a light in it yeah So like if the fire alarm goes off Yep That will just blink loudly I I think I also see that and maybe think that it produces sound so it has a speaker in it I think it probably serves both purposes But it definitely needs to for both of those things to either be detecting smoke which it s doing all the time it s just it may not may there may or may not be smoke particles there Both for that purpose and for the purpose of producing sound and having it easily nicely escape it needs to be open a little bit Good question I dunno Those are red Yep And it says fire Uh I would call it white I do agree that with the shadows right now it kinda looks gray Maybe very slightly gray It s pretty white maybe light gray I m ha I m happy with either Uh I do think as I get closer I think it is light gray I agree No if you back if you back up though Yeah if you back up I also think it s interesting that the letters are vertical and usually we have letters horizontal from left to right But the vertical here says fire It says it on the other side too Oh you think that s the temp It s in Fahrenheit Oh Yeah I feel it feels more like 72 to me Hey I was closer laughs Oh is it a is it an analog Sure This is a long board So it s a long version of a skateboard A a long It s a we call it a long board and it I think you could also call it a skate board that is long But we call them long boards Yeah I d say it s mostly black The wheels are a very dark red Especially because they ve been riding around on asphalt and they ve get been getting more dark it looks like That s a very cool image of some type of cat Maybe a tiger or something like that But it s a very artistic interpretation of one Yeah I said some type of cat I don t know about tiger Some type of Okay Nice The paint is coming off a little bit Yep It is definitely sparkly But the the main the main interesting to me purpose of this material is that it s very it has very high friction It s very grippy yeah And so that means as you re riding it what we do is we put our feet on it and then we shove ourselves around and we want it to be very high friction Should we demonstrate its use laughs That s a carabiner Kind of a yellow ish but kind of maybe brass I d also call it I do think it s definitely more yellow than lime green Yeah more yellow but But it s in it s in kind of the more metallic family of colors I would call it definitely closer to brass than I would to yellow It s blue Well this is blue The chalk is white Yeah That s a zipper So you can put something inside of there These This is a pair of shoes and it s a very particular type of shoe They are rock climbing shoes The shoes The shoes have many different colors cause here s some black here s some orange here s some yellow here s some red Those are the main colors on there They have shoe laces But then they re also they re hanging out here but then they also go all the way down and they re they re laced up in here This is for the right foot and this is for the left foot Mm hmm affirmative I think this is I think I might have brought this in It s a cup Um last time Whoops It s a cup and um I think I was drinking coffee out of it Design yeah laughs That s a little bit of a brown stain I would call it Yeah And that s left over from the coffee that was in there I m not sure it was mine It crosstalk though I would also call that a stain I are you

It is also silver Same color Metal Steel Steel crosstalk Yeah I I I would call it a cable maybe Mm hmm affirmative cause you have those like um power lines right Thi thi this sort of looks similar crosstalk cables I guess Mm hmm affirmative Yeah a cable Yeah inaudible about that Yeah I I think there s something about the light being at a parti at a particular frequency like it creates some kind of crosstalk Silver Texture A bolt Or nut Yeah Okay No it s good it s good D I m learning so much I would call it I would call it brown Yeah I don t think it s it s real wood Yeah inaudible I m intrigued how how fascinated you guys are by all the textures and like shapes in this room Yeah I know I understand but No Are very hard to Yeah A wall It is white I would say it s made out of plaster I actually know what it s made out of White is 250 all 255 I think it s also interesting that there s a shadow which Which which creates a discontinuity but it s like the surface itself is very uniform I mean that is the shadow of the beam which is black This thing it s black Yeah A beam support beam A pole It s uh it s black Okay Yeah The support is black It s black metallic it s painted um here it s a bit flaked so I think it is rusty Screws Oh I see yeah Like Yeah That s a mirror That is a very tricky question I can see it Sorry I would argue that the mirror itself is glass or is silver Yeah I mean but let s put it this way No but I think it has some innate color to itself as well I mean it s clearly not yellow right Like it it s clearly I it is a sort of similar color to this thing right here right The to the handrail Yeah I I think I think what it I think it it has to do with like diffuse or like directed light But if like light rays go in like you see an image but like if you if you just have a mirror and there s only diffused light around I think it would have a silver color And I don t feel very strongly about this but I could make this argument Yeah No no but i if Yeah but if all the incoming light is only diffused Yeah um if it s like completely random illumination I mean a perfect mirror I would I would say is May maybe that s my point Maybe this is not a perfect mirror because it still has it has some sort of intrinsic color property to it I dunno Yeah I think it depends also from which angle Yeah no the edge of the mirror is is this sort of like dark green That s possible Yeah I I would I I ll accept that And I I think I think that s the difference between I mean it depends on illumination right I mean it s just like light comes in on a particular spectrum and gets reflected with like a different like a different spectrum And the like difference between those is what you call a color Oh you re saying the material property is absorption and the I see what you mean But you could make a perfect material Awesome great Actually there are more objects that are maybe new here Yeah That s a fire alarm Uh that s a light Yeah it s a glass casing that has a light in it I think it is a smoke detector cause I think if there s a fire smoke will go through those um little gratings into a detector which then sets off the alarm No That s what I think Yeah Yes White Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah it also says fire twice Yeah And it and it says a number and I think the number is 75 And I have no idea what that number means You think it s also a Thermo But is it 75 75 is quite warm It doesn t feel like 75 Yeah Hmm Yeah Sure do that Yeah It has multiple colors It s um mostly black the the letters here are um white with some texture the wheels are red Yeah I think I think it s a cougar I m I m I m very yeah very sure that it s called a a cougar I mean that s what it s called That s like the bra brand name of the of the board And the board itself is made out of wood which you can see because Yeah We can we can talk about the surface of it Like yeah what color would you call this Dark gray Why is it sparkly I m Mm hmm affirmative Watch out Yeah No let s let s not do that Yeah you should probably unclip it Cause it just has a Oh actually yeah Wh wh why don t you ask me about the thing that you re unclipping right now What that is And what color does it have Yeah you should Let s let s take it out here cause I think you might change your mind I dunno I would call it sort of lime green Yeah Yeah If you put it if you put it next to this Okay Mm hmm affirmative Yeah That is a chalk bag That is a chalk ball Yeah okay Yeah I mean that s what they told me it was when I bought it so Uh the chalk itself That is a zipper Here should I hold it Uh sure Um so what is what is this Mm hmm affirmative Um Can you what what color does it have Yes this one Um Mm hmm affirmative This is a shoe lace So what is the difference between these two objects That s very interesting Wow Yeah Cool I can ask you about the brand of the shoes Do you wanna read what it is No Okay It s like a paper cup Mm hmm affirmative Yeah it s it s white it has some green um green letters and shapes on it This is a QR code um Yes And I m very curious what it goes to No There s um Yeah Mm hmm affirmative Yeah Yeah especially because it s like on this curved surface So you really

161,day_6__con_2,1,3,curtis,male,1395,2209,True,Okay so the game is super super like chill It s not It s not a crazy game So what I m gonna do is I m gonna rip up uh about three pieces of paper There s one for you and there s one for you laughs Yeah And one for me And then we re each gonna write a word Okay And we re gonna rotate them this way So I m gonna write a word for you And you re gonna write a word for him and he ll write a word for me Um The word is going to go on your forehead And you don t get to see it We re gonna go around in a circle and you get to ask questions and the first person to get their word wins But it s mostly just for fun Uh after that person wins the the other people keep guessing But the way you guess is you ask a question that s yes or no And the other person who didn t write it is the one who says Yes And then if the one the person who wins can just participate as much as they like after winning otherwise it s boring Um So that s that s it So uh try to we ll use nouns only No proper nouns And the word should be um something you think the person could guess but it should be not the simplest thing Yeah So I d recommend not like um dog okay That s terrible But someone said uh post which was just a little bit of a hard word to kind of come up with You know It It s not the worst word but yeah Someone put on my he head uh door handle I thought that was a pretty good word It s like I can get there eventually You know But it s not like dog So and it shouldn t be something like uh frustration That s not a good word Um Um That s right Metaphorical No that s not that s not even a noun Okay It It s Door handle is two words I prefer one word I only ever write one I ve done this three times and I ve always just done one word Every Other Everyone else always did two It I think that it s better to do one word so try to do one word If it needs to be two okay But I think you can usually come up with something that s one word that s Well yeah I mean you can do pool If the the person doesn t have to say the exact They just need to basically nail it We We ll know We ll be like You got it It s This is all in fun There s no no TV here Um inaudible to describe the word so I m gonna think of one for you You can watch I don t care But uh you don t get to look Um So I just need to need to come up with something Um Okay So I ve got it I m writing it down See that s the kind of word Ross Okay Is it okay I just said your name Uh but yeah That s the I m gonna put it on your head now This is the funny part Okay can you see okay There That s right It s not blocking your vision right Look at Look at him Laughs Uh Look at Look at him He looks funny Yeah Now y Laughs Now you write the word for me right Okay And uh uh so You can You can look at his You have a good word Okay So yeah you put it on me Yeah Do I look like my angle s good for seat sitting here Like is it angled down or up at all Even the most minute If you think it s angled any way at all Yeah Okay how s that Okay Alright And now you get to write one for Oh you already Oh that s a great one I think that s That s very doable I think that s very doable So I like both of your words a lot I think they re both very doable And you think mine s doable Okay then we have we ll have a good game Okay so the person who wrote the first word goes first So that s me Okay so I mean you both can If you both It just inaudible but yeah You guys can both work together But basically the person who didn t write it is sort of the leader Gets to make the final decision whether it s yes or no you know Okay Um so is mine alive And it usually goes around uh this way but Uh yeah counter clockwise Um That s not a good question Okay Yeah I guess yes Okay yes It is an object Oh yeah Push it down a little bit Yeah that s nice I just didn t want to block his vision Okay Yeah Um Uh is mine some like a pet Okay Alright Y Yes Yeah Yeah mostly Use Usually Um no No it s okay it s okay He ll put it on there Is that blocking your vision It s not blocking your Here let me try one more thing Let me just get rid of this Yeah but it s got I like it with the No no That s good that s good right That doesn t block your vision That s perfect Okay Um So mine s alive It s not a pet Is it uh is it bigger than that orange pillow Okay Okay Yeah inaudible Anyway Laughs No No it s not a bright color Um your turn Yeah Oh so it s not your turn Yes Um Okay Uh is um is this animal uh Man that s hard because there s so many animals I asked if it was an animal right Oh okay Um I think it s a okay Uh Can people have pet plants Laughs Well I guess I should confirm but I think the answer s yes Is it an animal Yeah okay Waste of a question Laughs It is alive No It does not Um Is is is mine just the name of like the animal or is it potentially the name of like part of the animal Oh like Yeah yeah sure Is the this word fully encompasses the entire animal not one of its parts Okay Cool Uh You asked that last time no Oh oh yeah It s an animal Yeah Uh no I think he ll get there Laughs Uh if not then we ll clarify eventually But I think I think he ll get there Yeah But if you look that word up in the dictionary the word plant would probably be in the definition Yeah That was worth like three clues but yeah Okay Um The fact that we even had to clarify I think is very helpful But um okay Uh So is my animal bigger than a uh that couch Okay Okay There are a lot of big animals out there Alright Your animal is bigger than that pillow That s the only thing you ve ever asked about size I was 100 sure We just that usually it s bigger No Oh right okay Um is uh is mine one that would typically be in a zoo Okay Yes It is a bird You you should go this time Flower Uh It is not flower Um we re doing good Um Is mine a hippo No I just wasted that question I thought it was a hippo Okay No Laughs I think I ve got mine I do but you go first I think I got it Uh Nope No No Um do I have a giraffe No What I Because I feel like I m close No That was three questions Remember that we said that we wouldn t call it a plant I don t think someone would call it a p Like that was the point of that clue Uh so I m gonna g let you have another question where you don t phrase the question as Is my plant Because that doesn t make sense because that was the point of yeah I just said that plant would be in the definition That s all If you look looked up that word uh I I think the word plant would probably be in the definition and you It definitely is very related to plants And it is not something that you would just say that that word is a plant No Small Almost always There are some exceptions but Basically around yeah Yes It usually is smaller than a bread box Um okay But I have seen bigger than a bread box Just throwing that out there Okay Um Is mine land dwelling It s not a giraffe or a hippo And it s bigger than the couch All of them they re always bigger than a couch when they re fully grown Am I allowed to ask that Like Okay Laughs Well yeah Laughs Laughs Sometimes I m gonna help No that would give the answer completely away Just kidding Let me help I m gonna help Can I help I wanna help I asked a question earlier that you really should ask And I think you ve forgotten it I think everyone s forgotten it But it was uh it was perfect for you Your word made me think I should ask it That It was Anyway I don t know if that s helpful Yeah It wasn t one we emphasized at any point and we just kinda moved on because the answer was no But anyway um okay Um Is uh I feel like I may not know the animal s name I just may not know the animal Is the animal like s like a very common animal to like talk about Is it a bear Okay Like no It s if it s in a zoo I ve seen it for sure It s just that I I actually don t know of any more animals that are bigger than that couch that aren t a giraffe or a hippo I mean I m sure I do know it but I can t think of the word And it s It s land dwelling So it s not like a whale or anything like that Is it in the family of cats What There s no cat bigger than a couch Yeah Okay Mm okay I ve got my answer then But uh You re a penguin Yeah you re a penguin You can yeah You re a penguin I m a lion Laughs Yeah I wouldn t I wouldn t say the lion s the same size Yeah I don t know That s hard I think a lion is not as long as a couch actually I don t know Yeah Maybe I picked a bad one for him I thought it was easy but now he maybe it s not that easy Yeah you might find on of these in in a in the weeds You could it could be there You ll find one of these pretty much anywhere outside I d say it s one of the most common things besides grass Laughs Okay I m gonna help you I asked a question The question was Is mine the

think you asked if it were alive and you asked if it were a pet They do have inaudible Yeah I ll I ll do the same thing Is this thing a living Is it alive Okay Okay Um can you phrase it as a yes or no question or I mean the first thing It is the first thing you said Yes Um Okay so I m a living thing that is about it s big but it can sometimes be a little smaller than the pillow Um And it doesn t have very bright colors Which makes me think if I ll I ll just confirm it Is it Is this thing an animal No No crosstalk Yeah We should maybe clarify Okay Well I think one of the the answers you gave mistakenly it s not correct When you When you said Is it a plant um the thing on there is not a specific plant Like it s it s not like a rose for example I don t know Yes it is related to plants but it is not the name of a particular plant Um I m gonna say maybe Probably yes It s a big animal Okay so I also have an animal which is probably not too big because it is only And it doesn t have very bright colors Okay Okay but you guys were not 100 sure about it Okay Usually okay Um I Is it a mammal Okay We can do that Yes Okay so I m not looking for a mammal I I Is it a bird Your word is not flower No It is a high risk question but you know high reward Um okay so I m a bird I I I ll just go for it as well Am I an eagle Oh Too bad No the word is not tree No I I like how we re we re having different strategies I m trying to like nail down categories You just go for the crosstalk Okay You are close Um Okay so I m a bird I don t have bright colors which is actually a inaudible when it comes to birds And but I m not a very big bird because most birds are smaller than this pillow Okay Um Do Is my natural habitat around tropic areas Or like sand crosstalk warm places Yeah Of a what It is small Cool Yes But it s not a giraffe How can that possibly be Yeah Yeah it is Um Okay so I Can I Hm Yeah It s a big animal But Can I fly No How fair is that I wish I could I would say no If I If I If you commit me to a yes or not answer it would be no Sure Laughs Okay I m gonna answer the first question Um Do you do you wanna phrase your question as is it an animal that you have seen before in your life Okay Yeah I mean I I I think the animal tends is bigger than you think it is I uh The the the couch is approximately the size of this animal Wh wh why don t you try to narrow it down the roughly the kind Yes This couch I don t know I mean I think I think these cats get pretty big Okay am I a penguin That s what I thought That was very nice Can I take it off now That s very cool Well it is not your turn yet But you would agree that a lion is probably bigger than this couch right I mean it s But it s higher but it s the same length but it s Yeah crosstalk Off in the weeds Is that a good thing Because did you ask if you are a flower Right so Is it If you asked a computer Is blank a plant it would say no But That should get you closer You re not a lion Laughs I was gonna say lion but then I changed my mind to a different cat Laughs Is that true Are you sure about that No I ve been saying this like the whole time that like I m not really sure about the answer but I m gonna go with yes It s about the same size But I don t think the lion is the biggest like crosstalk A cat that s bigger than a lion Okay think about Think about that Y y what do you think That s not right Do you want to ask me if it is a cougar Okay good Okay Yes You think so Well some tigers are I I think tigers are bigger than you think I think tigers are bigger than I think Okay imagine where his legs are right Like one leg is gonna be at the like if one leg is here at this end No no Just say they re standing just like wh wh wh how how far is are his legs apart Like more on this side and then like his head extends further than that Okay so you re a tiger That is your word so you can take it off if you want to And now you We can So you re not the roots of the plant but I think some plants have

well So what we re going to do is is one pen not but we ll share But we re each going to write a word okay And I m going to write a word for you and you re going to write a word for him and you re going to write a word for me The word needs to be a noun a non proper noun and your goal is to guess the word And we re going to put it on our forehead Okay So uh we ll like she you need to look at it when we write it okay You really not really I mean Otherwise the Yeah It s it s the goal is to not uh make the person unhappy With the word choice So um I would not choose for example the word frustration I would not choose that for you I would not choose the word happy for you It should be something that you can see That you can see in the world And it also should be something uh like an atom is an object but you can t see it So It s a it s actually that one s not too bad actually But uh really generic objects are the worst For example Post That s pretty rough I used that earlier And I think that was Frustrating So yeah words like uh cloud are pretty good but that s pretty easy Uh you know you can pick an animal anything you want really Just just don t pick something that you think will be like impossible for the person to come up with You know So um so think of a word I ll be thinking of one And I ll put the pen there And uh when you make and when you got your word He s making one for me I m making one for you Go for it So I I ll look at it but I ll see it on his head Yes So I should not see you what you write And I m going to do one for her Um And I m going to I just thought of this and I m kind of sorry but also not It s actually I think it s a great word I think it s very Yeah it s not something that necessarily you would talk about at work too much but it s not inappropriate It s a It s a real real deal thing You don t know what that word means What are you serious It s four it s four letters man No no I m using this one What do you mean whisper Are you serious What do you call what you blow out of your nose Of course Wait really Okay all right Well We can each start with uh we can tell each other how many letters each person s is So how many letters is is I m going to put this on your forehead So it s coming down And I ll put it right in there Is that okay mumbles inaudible I m I m I m okay Wait There you go So is that okay Okay All right Um yeah I mean okay This is for my forehead Okay You might want to put it on And how many letters is it Okay Six letters It s good yeah Okay so can you read mine and hers You just you saw it already Okay so whoever wrote it first starts and we go around kind of clockwise Or let s go around Yeah Uh no You get one And then And then your turn You ask both of us Um is it is mine alive Okay Uh no It has to be yes or no And if we really want to help you out we can help you out more but we want to try not to No Um is mine uh like artificially created By man Like mankind Okay Natural Yeah Yeah Uh so I just ask Okay so we all asked the same question Mine is unnatural Manufactured Okay um yeah it s better than made by man Um Uh uh okay so Is mine bigger than that orange pillow Okay Usually Okay Um Some days Um is mine uh uh no like noise producing I don t know He s just saying no and you re saying yes and I But it s sound producing Okay Uh no Um okay Is mine uh bigger than a pen Okay No Um is you can t see the words in the reflection right Of the In the glasses Okay all right Um okay is mine electronic Everything around here is qualified Okay Thank you Uh no As many as you want No That s it that s the question Um so mine s electronic and between a pencil a pen and and a pillow usually Usually electronic That s like true for everything lately Like literally everything Yeah okay okay Okay that s true Like yeah Um is it something you use to to for work Okay Yeah It s a laptop I thought for sure All right thanks for letting me thanks for letting me sneak in two questions Computers existed before people Humans were computers before Okay I mean I guess humans could sit on your lap and compute laughs You could move it Yeah It s not in the sea Yeah lift it up for sure It s okay Um okay Uh it s electronic and it s at work and it s not a computer and most people use it every day and it s six letters Oh Yeah Um I I actually like all day I just I use only my laptop I think but maybe I use a charger to charge it Oh yeah Okay Six letters laughs No no I haven t Um um this sucks I don t know I don t even know what to ask Yeah that sounds good So is it uh does it um like perform computations Ugh Okay Okay I would say definitely not the second Which is two different questions But the first one could potentially it could possibly be used artistically but then again I think you could use almost anything in an artistic capacity No laughs I know it s like cutting the animals into Yeah Um does mine involve food crosstalk yeah we can see it No Um I ll help you out And say you you don t you don t purchase it which is a lot of information I think but yeah Typically ownership implies you like own it That s a different question In the zoo Heck yeah I think most most many zoos yeah Yeah Um is um does the does the item involve like printing Okay Does it generate words on paper in some capacity Yes Is it Yeah laughs I didn t think it was that hard Is Is mine like in like I m

article of Oh and then we go around Okay fine Right crosstalk you can ask either of us Yeah we can both see the word No No Uh is mine something a person would normally wear or carry Okay No Yes Yeah that s what I was going to ask Is mine manufactured or natural Okay Natural So I guess you could have a two option question not just yes or no It s the same It s the same data bandwidth All right He was trying to yeah Okay Yep Yes yours is natural Mine is natural And yours is not natural yeah Yours is manufactured laughs No It could be Yeah usually no Uh let s see Is mine something I m likely to encounter during the day Okay No Barely It most types will produce one distinctive sound But no other sound laughs I don t know maybe that s too detailed for the answer It s purpose is not to produce sound It produces a single distinctive sound as a side effect on most versions laughs Okay so mine is natural and something I may encounter during the day and I forget what else I asked Um let s see Oh it s not something I would use at work I think I asked Let s see And it s natural Is it is mine a plant or animal Okay Hm But it s natural No Not in this area Um almost certainly laughs Uh let s see Is mine a mineral or like a product of the earth somehow laughs okay I think I might know what it is laughs I don t know Maybe not Yes Oh I haven t been trying laughs Uh yes Almost always laughs There are many types of the thing that he wrote Um it s a wide encompassing noun Um is is mine in outer space Oh okay I don t know what it is then crosstalk It s not a product of the earth and it s not a plant or animal And it has four letters Hm A guess Sure No laughs You just get one question You get one yes or no question laughs Um no Do you There were versions that existed before electronics That s probably information but yeah crosstalk Yeah Yeah I mean if it was like smartphone of something like there weren t smartphones before there were electronics but Yeah Yeah Yes Most I mean not everyone Many people here do yeah It s not a laptop laughs good guess though All laptops are electronic laughs Yeah I mean Laptop tablets of clay I guess You said laptop not computer laughs Also humans are larger than the pillow Yes Yeah humans yeah computers used to mean human Okay Uh I need to figure out what mine is Okay So it s not a product of the earth or mineral it s not a plant it s not an animal but it is natural and it s four letters And it s not in outer space That s eliminating a lot of things And it s something I might see during the day Hm Is it something I could move if I tried to move it Okay No Land animal Mine s falling into my eye Okay laughs laughs It s like a crossword Except you don t get any of the letters Mm hmm affirmative I said most people here use them for work Not every day but I think I would say most people here probably use them in some capacity Yeah laughs You already asked or did you ask a question Okay I would give you a hint to ask crosstalk I would try to narrow down its functionality Oh it can but usually no laughs Sorry Yeah okay Sure no yeah It s core functionality is not to perform computations Right Uh okay um I have no idea Um is it something uh is it something that I would use for some kind of this is going to be a long question Some kind of cultural like would I ever use this for some kind of cultural thing like artistic expression or produc productivity laughs Okay Yeah That s true Yeah that s true Ah And it s not a mineral or a product or a plant or an animal but it is natural No Good elimination of giant swaths of animals though Mm hmm affirmative No Um We can see it Um hm Do I own one of these Okay And it s not an animal or plant or mineral Okay Humans are animals It s not a okay it s not an animal All right Hm Is it a part of an animal Damn it laughs Sorry Yes Probably Well stocked zoos Yeah Hmm hmm no Some of well yeah for No Yeah yeah Um I feel like it s going to be really obvious once I get it but it s not yet Um is it is it a part of an animal Is it a part of any living thing Okay laughs It s probably a body part I was thinking it was an object Yeah well components of well yours is really hard too but for a similar but different reason Anyway yeah Yes laughs Yeah yeah yeah That s a good question It can be It can be stand alone or or a component Okay Is mine a human body part in the upper half of the human body Gah laughs I should have just asked if it s a human body part No It s larger than a dog No laughs It is taller than a horse but it is not larger in volume than a horse laughs We should start getting more helpful probably There are many of them in this room No It s a good guess though Mirrors I don t think are ever electronic Yeah You give me more of a hint laughs Or any kind of way to narrow it down No you said it wasn t Oh So Okay What It s not a body part but it is in the upper half of my body Huh Interesting And it s natural It s something natural And it s not something I would wear or carry but it s in the upper half of my body it must be something I have grown Is it something I have grown myself laughs Does it does it does it exist because it s made out of food that I ve eaten in the past Produce Okay Hm How interesting Because I was going to say hair but it doesn t sound like it s hair Is it hair laughs crosstalk Okay Fine laughs Next time I ll ask if it s hair laughs No I don t think that s is that seven it s eight letters so giraffe I think is five seven letters G I R A F F E Yeah Yeah Giraffe s seven but yours is eight If I were you I would narrow it down more either by how this animal gets around or where it where it is found There s a bunch in this room Do you do you want another you want a really good hint laughs Yeah Electronic or components That s true Mm hmm affirmative It is a hard one because it is a little conceptual or it s become that way Do you want another hint laughs Mm hmm affirmative laughs I I can I m looking at one right now laughs Sorry yes That is a hard one though because it s in everything and they re electronic and not and they re different sizes and they do different things Some of them print like there are cameras that print That s okay I think I think it I think we ve all been thinking about like very self contained objects And then we pick things that weren t that Well I did I picked one Is mine is it hair Yeah It s not a body part I mean the only thing I can think of are like Like saliva and carbon dioxide that I exhale and stuff but like like tears But those Earwax laughs Skin flakes Yeah like none of the stuff s four letters that s the thing It s like Four letters is not very many letters laughs Dust Bacteria Okay It was laughs No laughs Close Close laughs It is uh It is let s see For an animal of its size It is very not closely related to humans Like it s it s unusually It s unusually non related to humans Yeah What Uh it looks it s similar in shape sort of but it is not related to humans closely at all laughs I mean like in terms of like the the tree of life right Sort of like the Yeah You may mistake it for human Yeah It s not a monkey It is much farther No It is much farther away from humans on a tree than laughs Yeah laughs Okay is this only produced by humans or also by is this is this produced by non living things That s my question Because like dust is produced by humans but it s also produced by I m very confused Okay Yeah yeah Oh Snot Okay laughs Yeah I never would have gotten yeah okay muc yeah I was there with tears and everything yeah I never I missed crosstalk a facial feature Yeah yeah yeah I know Yeah yeah Yeah crosstalk Yeah it s not a just a slang for Like nose mucus Yeah It was it was mostly hard because It s not something I think about very much And it s not something people talk about very much and then also yeah it s not a body like it s hard to classify Right Because I was trying to carve out classifications like didn t follow any of them No that s okay Oh So it s on your mind laughs And I blow my nose too but I don t I don t assign it a name in my mind right Like there are there are named things and then there are things that are just there That s very funny Yeah it s similar to yours right cameras are so ubiquitous now That you almost don t even think about them I don t know Because you went straight to laptop and I kind of want to say like your laptop has one laughs But we re using them right now Yeah yeah Yeah that s interesting Well and I mean and they are in laptops Like almost all laptops have cameras now So crosstalk they re at least around Hm crosstalk Do you want more hints Okay It has a very substantial tail laughs Yeah a kangaroo laughs Pocket s too easy Yeah Yeah yeah I mean hopping I was going to talk about like it has a unusual crosstalk Yeah It gives birth in an unusual way Um it s an unusual animal family Uh it s on a landmass that s isolated right I don t know Yeah yeah yeah That

There s a definition for life It has to reproduce it has to uh um consume input output of some kind And it reproduces And all the other It dies It can t be alive if you don t die Otherwise it wouldn t have been alive Every time Every time it s this weird Okay Okay alright okay Um I would say I would say no You don t You do not buy what s on your head At a store No Yes Uh do you buy mine in the

maybe it s alive Is it something that you would learn about in biology Thanks Okay Yeah yeah I would say easily Yeah for sure definitely Strong yes no matter what she says No what s up what s up Why you gotta say that word It s usually found outside That s a true statement though it s usually found Found outside I m just answering her question I don t feel like it s tricky at all It is usually outside Yeah I mean I mean we can just say that they re found both places But I would say that there are more of them outside than inside Alright let me whisper one more thing to her There are probably seventeen trillion of these in the ocean Yeah Definitely a lot more Okay Definitely way more outside Outside yeah Yeah Um is mine is my word the whole thing or part of the thing It s the whole thing Uh No you did not ask and the answer is no It is not alive Uh yes I would say objectively it s bigger than your fist yes If you can I would say that it is always except for very few ones

Another one if you want I ll also just tell you it s uh we already told you it s usually outside actually Oh of the inside What is the inside Sure it could be in a house Sure But you can ask another question cause that doesn t help It could be in a house sure Um it can be Can also be naturally occurring That s very helpful Uh yours does not take a battery We re thinking of our we re thinking about our own Yours has nothing Yours has nothing to do with a battery We re trying to figure out our own right So we re like getting confused Um cause mine doesn t it s not electronic it s not

structure for an entire building bigger than a TV that goes inside a building Oh my gosh Most columns I strongly feel that most columns are bigger than televisions Even in that one It s a column like it supports a building Like like like this Okay um I have no idea I really have no idea so um I m just gonna say is it bigger than that pen I m confident that there are probably Between 100 to 1000000 times more outside than inside Definitely not alive Yeah sure That s your question but yeah Something like that Yes Definitely Yeah it s definitely more tall than it is wide Lay it on a table it s more long than it is wide Yeah it s not confusing at all It is longer than it is wide It s really not confusing Yeah Just a normal object like a pin Longer than it is wide Yeah Okay um does mine
